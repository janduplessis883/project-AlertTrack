# Abrysvo▼ (Pfizer RSV vaccine) and Arexvy▼ (GSK RSV vaccine): be alert to a small risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome following vaccination in older adults

There is a small increase in the risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome following vaccination with Abrysvo (Pfizer respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine) and Arexvy (GSK RSV vaccine) in adults aged 60 years and older. Healthcare professionals should advise all recipients of Abrysvo and Arexvy that they should be alert to signs and symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome and, if they occur, to seek immediate medical attention as it requires urgent treatment in hospital.

There is currently no evidence of an increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome in pregnant women following vaccination with Abrysvo, the only RSV vaccine approved for use during pregnancy. The Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) advise that the benefits of vaccination against RSV outweigh the small risk of developing Guillain-Barré syndrome in older adults.

## Advice for Healthcare Professionals:

- there is a small increase in the risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome following vaccination with Abrysvo and Arexvy in adults (aged 60 years and older). Currently, there is no evidence of an increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome in pregnant women following vaccination with Abrysvo, the only RSV vaccine approved for use during pregnancy

- be attentive to signs and symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome in all recipients of Abrysvo and Arexvy to ensure early and correct diagnosis, initiate adequate supportive care and treatment, and rule out other causes

- early medical care can reduce severity and improve outcomes

- report suspected adverse drug reactions associated with Abrysvo and Arexvy on a [Yellow Card](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)


## Advice for Healthcare Professionals to Provide to Patients:

- the RSV vaccine helps protect against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a virus which can make older adults and babies seriously ill. RSV can cause a type of chest infection called bronchiolitis in babies which can cause breathing problems and may need to be treated in hospital. RSV can also cause a serious lung infection (pneumonia) in and older adults requiring hospital care in some cases

- the Pfizer RSV vaccine Abrysvo is currently offered in NHS vaccination programmes against RSV to adults aged 75-79 years old and to pregnant women to help protect babies after they are born

- the GSK RSV vaccine Arexvy is not currently available on the NHS but may be available privately for use in individuals aged 60 years and older, or those aged 50–59 years who are at increased risk of RSV disease; Arexvy should not be given to pregnant individuals

- rare or very rare cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome have been reported in older adults who have received the Abrysvo or Arexvy RSV vaccines respectively. Currently, there is no evidence that the Abrysvo RSV vaccine increases the risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome in pregnant women

- Guillain-Barré syndrome is a serious nerve condition. It usually affects your arms and legs first before you get symptoms in other parts of your body

- you might feel tingling, numbness or pins and needles in your feet and hands first. This is usually followed by muscle weakness and difficulty moving your joints

- other symptoms can include:
  - tingling, numbness or pins and needles in your feet and hands
  - muscle weakness and difficulty moving your joints
  - sharp, shooting pain (nerve pain), often in your legs or back
  - problems breathing
  - problems with your face, such as drooping face muscles or trouble swallowing or speaking
  - problems with your eyes, such as double vision
- some people’s symptoms become so severe that they are not able to move their legs, arms and face (paralysis)

- urgent hospital treatment is required to help prevent the symptoms progressing and improve recovery, however the effects of Guillain-Barré syndrome may sometimes be long-lasting

- seek immediate medical attention if you notice signs of Guillain-Barré syndrome

- report suspected side effects associated with the RSV vaccine on a [Yellow Card](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)


## Background

### NHS vaccination programmes against RSV

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an infectious disease of the airways and lungs. RSV infection is common in young children but is most serious for small babies and for older people. Abrysvo (Pfizer RSV vaccine) is currently being used in NHS vaccination programmes against RSV in older adults aged 75 to 79 years old and in pregnant women to protect their infants.

### Risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome in older adults following RSV vaccine

An increase in the risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome has been observed following vaccination with Abrysvo and Arexvy in adults aged 60 years and older.

Up to 2 June 2025, the MHRA received 21 Yellow Card reports of suspected Guillain-Barré syndrome in older adults (75-79 years, where known) following Abrysvo. This is in the context of over 1.9 million doses of Abrysvo administered in the older adult RSV vaccination programme up to 26 May 2025. Over the same time period, the MHRA has not received any Yellow Card reports of suspected Guillain-Barré syndrome following Arexvy however there has been very limited use of this vaccine in the UK to date as Arexvy (GSK RSV vaccine) is not currently deployed by the NHS.

A post-marketing observational study.[\[footnote 1\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/abrysvov-pfizer-rsv-vaccine-and-arexvyv-gsk-rsv-vaccine-be-alert-to-a-small-risk-of-guillain-barre-syndrome-following-vaccination-in-older-adults#fn:1) in the United States in individuals aged 65 years and older estimated that Abrysvo and Arexvy were associated with 9 and 7 excess Guillain-Barré syndrome cases per million vaccine doses administered, respectively. Preliminary unpublished post-marketing study data from the UK Health Security Agency and Public Health Scotland studies in adults aged 75-79 years estimate a combined excess of 15-25 Guillain-Barré syndrome cases per million vaccine doses of Abrysvo administered across England and Scotland. The risk of experiencing Guillain-Barré syndrome following Abrysvo in older adults remains rare. No UK post-marketing study data for Arexvy are available.

The new UK data regarding Abrysvo were reviewed by the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) who advised that the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risk of developing Guillain-Barré syndrome in older adults.

### Risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome in pregnancy following Abrysvo

Abrysvo is the only RSV vaccine indicated for use during pregnancy to protect infants. Up to 2 June 2025, the MHRA has not received any Yellow Card reports of suspected Guillain-Barré syndrome in pregnant individuals following Abrysvo. This is in the context of over a quarter of million doses of Abrysvo administered in the pregnancy RSV vaccination programme up to 26 May 2025.

Currently, there is no evidence of an increase in the risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome following Abrysvo in pregnant individuals from either UK or world-wide data.

### Product information for patients and healthcare professionals

The Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and the Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) for Abrysvo and Arexvy contain warnings about the risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Guillain-Barré syndrome is also listed as possible side effect in older adults in the product information for these vaccines.

# IXCHIQ Chikungunya vaccine: temporary suspension in people aged 65 years or older

The Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) has temporarily restricted use of the IXCHIQ Chikungunya vaccine in people aged 65 years and over following very rare fatal reactions reported globally. This is a precautionary measure while the MHRA conducts a safety review. The IXCHIQ vaccine will be available on the UK market from 18 June 2025.

18 June 2025



## Advice for Healthcare Professionals:

- Chikungunya vaccine (IXCHIQ) is a vaccine to protect against life-threatening Chikungunya virus infection; strict adherence to contraindications and precautions is essential to reduce the risk of very rare but potentially fatal adverse reactions
- following a review of the benefits and risks of the vaccine, CHM has made a recommendation to restrict use of this vaccine in individuals aged 65 years and older, while data is reviewed from global cases
- do not use this vaccine in people aged over 65 years for the period of the suspension
- the product information for the vaccine will not change during this suspension, but a letter for healthcare professionals will be circulated from the company in addition to this Drug Safety Update, to advise of the restrictions on those aged 65 and above
- IXCHIQ vaccine is already contraindicated in all individuals with immunodeficiency or immunosuppression as a result of disease or medical therapy, this includes IgA deficiency
- patients who have received the vaccine should be advised to seek emergency medical attention if they develop signs or symptoms associated with viraemia, including arthralgia, or neurological symptoms including encephalopathy
- all patients who have received the vaccine should receive the manufacturer’s [patient information leaflet](https://mhraproducts4853.blob.core.windows.net/docs/a68342fbc54737797aa5b725e09cca2f46372413) as part of the travel consultation
- further communications will be circulated to inform of the outcome of the review
- report suspected adverse reactions associated with the IXCHIQ vaccine on a [Yellow Card](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)

## Advice for Healthcare Professionals to Provide to Patients:

- the Chikungunya vaccine is given to those who plan to travel abroad to certain regions, where the Chikungunya virus is present. Chikungunya virus is a potentially life-threatening viral infection
- a live attenuated Chikungunya vaccine, IXCHIQ, is coming to the UK market on 18 June 2025, it has not been available on the UK market before this time
- the IXCHIQ vaccine should not be used for people aged 65 years and over until MHRA has completed a full safety review. This is because there have been rare reports of serious side effects in this age group globally
- during your vaccine consultation you will be assessed by a healthcare professional for vaccine suitability, you will not be given this vaccine if you are aged over 65 years old, or if you are immunosuppressed or immunodeficient. Alternative vaccines are available for these groups
- if you have received a Chikungunya vaccine, you should seek urgent medical attention if you start to experience joint pain, fever, stiff neck or confusion

## Trigger for detailed review and recommendations

Following global reports of serious adverse events in older people, the government’s independent expert advisory body, the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM), has temporarily restricted use of a Chikungunya vaccine called IXCHIQ in people aged 65 and over until a further safety review has been concluded.

This is a precautionary measure while the MHRA conducts the safety review.

The MHRA is working with the manufacturer of the IXCHIQ vaccine, Valneva. This vaccine was approved by the MHRA in February 2025. There will be no impact on operational issues as this vaccine has only become available in the UK as of 18 June and therefore there is no immediate safety concern.

The decision to restrict the licence until further review is based on global data which has highlighted 23 cases of serious adverse reactions, including two cases reporting a fatal outcome. Given that studies on IXCHIQ mainly involved people below 65 years of age and the vast majority of serious cases concerned people 65 years of age and above, the CHM is temporarily recommending restricting the use of vaccine in individuals aged 65 years and above. There are no changes in the recommendations for vaccination with IXCHIQ for people of 18 to 64 years of age.

The vaccine is currently contraindicated in individuals with immunodeficiency or immunosuppression as a result of disease or medical therapy.

## About the IXCHIQ Chikungunya Vaccine

Chikungunya virus is a potentially life-threatening viral infection and protective measures against the disease are essential for anyone travelling to an area where there is a risk of infection.

Chikungunya virus is found in the subtropical regions of the Americas, Africa, Southeast Asia, India, and the Pacific Region, and is spread to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus). It cannot be passed from human to human.

For most people, the balance between the benefits and possible side effects of the IXCHIQ vaccine remains overwhelmingly favourable. However, because the IXCHIQ vaccine contains a live, weakened strain of the Chikunguya virus, strict adherence to contraindications and precautions is essential to reduce the risk of serious side effects in those who may have a weaker immune system.

Serious side effects that resemble Chikunguya infection are very rare but can be fatal, these include rare neurological symptoms including encephalopathy. These risks are more likely to occur in certain groups, particularly people with a weakened immune system.

At vaccination, all vaccinees should receive the manufacturer’s [patient information leaflet](https://mhraproducts4853.blob.core.windows.net/docs/a68342fbc54737797aa5b725e09cca2f46372413) for IXCHIQ vaccine, which advises them on symptoms to be vigilant for following vaccination.

# Valproate (Belvo, Convulex, Depakote, Dyzantil, Epilim, Epilim Chrono or Chronosphere, Episenta, Epival, and Syonell▼): updated safety and educational materials to support patient discussion on reproductive risks

Updated safety and educational materials are now available to support the implementation of the regulatory measures announced in the November 2023 National Patient Safety Alert and the September 2024 Drug Safety Update. They also include previous updates to product information on the risk of low birth weight in children exposed to valproate during pregnancy.

10 June 2025



## Advice for Healthcare Professionals:

- updated safety and educational materials are now available to support healthcare professionals and patients to implement the existing regulatory requirements
- the updates reflect:
  - precautionary advice on the potential risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children fathered by men taking valproate around the time of conception
  - a risk of lower weight at birth for the gestational age in children exposed to valproate during pregnancy
- healthcare professionals should review the new materials and integrate them into their clinical practice when referring patients and when prescribing or dispensing valproate

## As a reminder

- valproate must not be started in new patients (male or female) younger than 55 years unless two specialists independently consider and document that there is no other effective or tolerated treatment, or there are compelling reasons that the reproductive risks do not apply
- valproate must not be prescribed to any woman or girl able to have children unless the conditions of the [Pregnancy Prevention Programme](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/valproate-pregnancy-prevention-programme-actions-required-now-from-gps-specialists-and-dispensers) (PPP) are followed
- as a precaution, recommend that male patients use effective contraception (condoms, plus contraception used by the female sexual partner) throughout the valproate treatment period and for 3 months after stopping valproate, to allow for one completed sperm cycle not exposed to valproate. For further information see the [September 2024 Drug Safety Update](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/valproate-use-in-men-as-a-precaution-men-and-their-partners-should-use-effective-contraception)
- report suspected adverse reactions associated with valproate on [Yellow Card](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)

## Advice for Healthcare Professionals to Provide to Patients:

- do not stop taking valproate without advice from a specialist. This is because epilepsy or bipolar disorder may worsen without treatment
- women and girls who are able to have children and who are taking valproate must follow the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme
- as a precaution it is recommended that male patients taking valproate should use effective contraception (condoms, plus contraception used by the female sexual partner) throughout the valproate treatment period and for 3 months after stopping valproate
- if you are on valproate, please attend any offered appointments to discuss your treatment plan and talk to a healthcare professional if you are concerned. If you wish to discuss family planning, please contact a healthcare professional
- consult the [Patient Information Leaflet](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/files/pil.1446.pdf) and [Patient Guide for men](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/rmm/104334/Document) or [Patient Guide for women](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/rmm/104335/Document) for information about the risks of valproate – also the [MHRA information page](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/valproate-reproductive-risks) for information resources

## Background

In September 2024, precautionary advice was communicated in [Drug Safety Update](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/valproate-use-in-men-as-a-precaution-men-and-their-partners-should-use-effective-contraception) on a potential risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children fathered by men taking valproate around the time of conception. In February 2025, a [Drug Safety Update](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/valproate-belvo-convulex-depakote-dyzantil-epilim-epilim-chrono-or-chronosphere-episenta-epival-and-syonellv-review-by-two-specialists-is-required-for-initiating-valproate-but-not-for-male-patients-already-taking-valproate) communicated that review by two specialists remains in place for all patients initiating valproate under 55 years of age but the Commission on Human Medicines had advised that it will not be required for men (or males) currently taking valproate. Three infographics were published to clarify in which situations review by two specialists may be required:

## Risk of lower weight at birth for gestational age

Product information has been updated to reflect epidemiological studies (please see references in ‘Additional Information’ section) which have reported a decrease in mean birth weight, and a higher risk of being born with a low birth weight (<2500 grams) or small for gestational age (defined as birth weight below the 10th percentile corrected for their gestational age, stratified by gender) for children exposed to valproate in utero in comparison to unexposed or lamotrigine-exposed children.

## Updated safety and educational materials

Safety and educational materials have been updated in line with the current regulatory position and to reflect feedback from stakeholders.

# Thiopurines and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy

Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) has been rarely reported in patients treated with azathioprine products and is believed to be a risk applicable to all drugs in the thiopurine class (azathioprine, mercaptopurine and tioguanine). Cholestasis of pregnancy associated with thiopurines tends to occur earlier in pregnancy than non drug-induced cholestasis of pregnancy, and elevated bile acid levels may not reduce with ursodeoxycholic acid.

## Advice for Healthcare Professionals:

- cholestasis of pregnancy has rarely been reported in association with azathioprine therapy
- this risk is believed to also apply to the other thiopurine drugs, mercaptopurine and tioguanine
- it may occur earlier in pregnancy than non drug-induced cholestasis of pregnancy, and it may not respond to ursodeoxycholic acid
- withdrawal or dose reduction of the thiopurine drug may improve liver function tests
- remain vigilant to signs and symptoms of ICP in pregnant patients taking thiopurines and discuss any concerns with clinicians managing the patient’s immunosuppressant therapy and a hepatologist, as necessary
- if cholestasis of pregnancy occurs, a case-by-case assessment is required to determine the appropriate course of action. Consider the risks and benefits of remaining on the product against the risks and benefits of stopping.
- in patients with ICP, measure serum bile acids to identify pregnancies at particular risk of spontaneous preterm birth (≥40uM) or stillbirth (non-fasting serum bile acids ≥100uM)

## Advice for Healthcare Professionals to Provide to Patients:

- talk to your doctor or midwife immediately if you experience symptoms of cholestasis of pregnancy which include intense itching without a rash, nausea, and loss of appetite
- do not stop taking your medication unless advised to do so by your doctor or midwife

## Background

The thiopurines include azathioprine, 6-Mercaptopurine and thioguanine (also known as tioguanine). Their uses are in anticancer indications, primarily leukaemia, and immunosuppression to treat inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and to increase graft survival following organ transplant.

Thiopurines should only be used in pregnancy where a careful benefit/risk assessment for the individual patient has been made.

A risk of developing intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) has been identified from a small number of case reports in the scientific literature. ICP has been reported in some pregnant patients treated with azathioprine and mercaptopurine and, due to similar metabolic pathways utilised by thiopurines, this risk is believed to be applicable to all drugs in the thiopurine class (azathioprine, mercaptopurine and tioguanine).

For context, the occurrence of thiopurine-induced ICP is thought to occur much less frequently than non thiopurine-induced ICP, which occurs in roughly 1 in every 150 pregnancies.

Case reports occur mainly in patients being treated for IBD or in transplant recipients. In many cases, ICP associated with thiopurine treatment has developed earlier in pregnancy than typical non drug-induced ICP and in some cases bile acid levels did not reduce with ursodeoxycholic acid. However, in some cases, improvement in bile acid and liver function did occur on stopping thiopurine.

Reported cases were often serious with some resulting in fetal death. However, reporting bias may result in the more serious cases being reported.

Early diagnosis and discontinuation or dose reduction of the thiopurine may minimise adverse effects on the fetus. A thorough assessment of the important benefits of treatment of the underlying disease against the risk of thiopurines to the mother and the effects of ICP on the fetus should be performed if ICP is confirmed.

In patients with ICP, measure serum bile acids to identify pregnancies at particular risk of spontaneous preterm birth (≥40uM) or stillbirth (non-fasting serum bile acids ≥100uM).

Patients should be made aware of the signs and symptoms of ICP, which include intense itching without a rash, nausea, and loss of appetite, and advised to seek healthcare professional advice immediately if they experience these symptoms.

# Kaftrio▼ (Ivacaftor, tezacaftor, elexacaftor): risk of psychological side effects

Psychological side effects such as anxiety, low mood, sleep disturbance, poor concentration, and forgetfulness have been infrequently reported in people with cystic fibrosis treated with Kaftrio. Healthcare professionals should advise patients and their caregivers that, while the risk is small, they should be alert to changes in mood and behaviour and, if they occur, to seek medical advice as soon as possible.

## Advice for Healthcare Professionals:

- there is a small increase in the risk of psychological side effects in people with cystic fibrosis treated with Kaftrio
- there is also an indirect risk of psychological side effects from difficulty adjusting to Kaftrio-related improvements to physical health and quality of life
- individuals with life-limiting conditions such as cystic fibrosis also have an increased background risk of developing poor mental health
- advise patients and their caregivers to be alert to the development of psychological side effects usually within the first three months of treatment including anxiety or low mood, sleep disturbance, poor concentration, or forgetfulness. The side effects may occur in people who have no history of these problems
- in some children, the psychological side effects may manifest themselves as persistent changes in behaviour while taking Kaftrio. Signs of this could include being more disruptive or difficult to manage
- discuss the benefit-risk balance of Kaftrio treatment with the patient or caregiver and consider treatment discontinuation if a patient develops these symptoms
- report suspected adverse drug reactions associated with Kaftrio on a [Yellow Card](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)

## Advice for Healthcare Professionals to Provide to Patients:

- Kaftrio is a medicine used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis
- there have been infrequent reports in patients of all ages of low or altered mood, anxiety, problems with sleep, concentration, and/or forgetfulness
- some children, while taking Kaftrio, may notice persistent changes in the way they feel and/or act that are different to their usual patterns. This includes being more disruptive or difficult to manage
- these events usually happen within the first three months after starting treatment with Kaftrio and may occur in people who have no history of these problems
- it can be difficult for patients to know if their symptoms relate to Kaftrio or to something else. For some people, these changes can be associated with adjusting to the improvements that Kaftrio has on their physical health and their quality of life
- for many, the symptoms may not last long, but others will continue to experience them whilst they take Kaftrio
- you may not notice some changes in your mood and behaviour so it is very important to tell your friends and family that you are taking this medicine and that it can have psychological side effects. Others may notice changes and help you quickly identify any symptoms that you need to talk to your doctor about
- talk to your doctor or cystic fibrosis team as soon as possible if you or your family or friends notice signs or symptoms of psychological side effects. Your doctor will advise on the most appropriate action to take
- report suspected adverse drug reactions associated with Kaftrio on a [Yellow Card](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)

## Background

#### Review of adverse psychological side effects with Kaftrio

Adults and children with chronic diseases including cystic fibrosis are at an increased risk of experiencing adverse psychological effects. In addition, individuals with cystic fibrosis who experience marked improvements in wellness related to their cystic fibrosis may sometimes have difficulty in adjusting to the benefits of Kaftrio. [\[footnote 1\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/kaftriov-ivacaftor-tezacaftor-elexacaftor-risk-of-psychological-side-effects#fn:1)

The Cystic Fibrosis Trust shared with the MHRA a suspected risk of adverse psychological effects during treatment with Kaftrio. This included reports of anxiety or low mood, sleep disruption, disturbances in concentration, and forgetfulness. It also included reports of persistent changes in behaviour in children while taking Kaftrio. These events frequently occurred within the first three months after starting treatment. The MHRA reviewed the available evidence for the risk, including experiences and insights provided by representatives from the cystic fibrosis community and the Cystic Fibrosis Trust. The review sought independent expert advice from the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM). The CHM advised that there is a small increase in the risk of developing adverse psychological effects during treatment with Kaftrio in a minority of people with cystic fibrosis. This risk may be associated with the medication itself but it could also be related to patients adjusting to improvements that Kaftrio has on their physical health and their quality of life. The CHM advised that healthcare professionals should discuss the benefit-risk balance of Kaftrio treatment with the patient or caregiver and consider treatment discontinuation if a patient develops these symptoms.

#### Updated product information for patients and healthcare professionals

Information to describe the risk will be added to the Kaftrio [Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Patient Information Leaflet (PIL)](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/search?q=kaftrio) in the UK The updates will include a warning on the risk of side effects on mood, sleep, concentration and behaviour and advise that patients and caregivers should be advised to monitor for these symptoms. The product information will also advise that patients or carers of patients taking Kaftrio must contact their healthcare professional as soon as possible if the patient experiences these side effects.

#### Other cystic fibrosis modulators

Advice from independent experts is that there is insufficient evidence to indicate an increased risk of adverse psychological side effects with other cystic fibrosis modulators currently approved in the UK which were considered by this review ( [Kalydeco](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/search?q=Kalydeco), [Orkambi](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/search?q=Orkambi) and [Symkevi](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/search?q=Symkevi)).

#### UK reports of adverse psychological effects with Kaftrio

Up to 25 February 2025, the MHRA received 300 Yellow Card reports of suspected adverse psychological side effects in patients treated with Kaftrio. This is in the context of a total of 9391 people in the UK who have taken Kaftrio by 10 January 2025. It is not possible to determine the frequency of these events from the currently available data. Some patients affected had no medical history of mental health issues.

#### About Kaftrio

Kaftrio belongs to a class of medicines known as cystic fibrosis modulators which target the underlying defective protein in cystic fibrosis, restoring normal protein function in the lung and other organs. Kaftrio is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor (Kalydeco) for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients aged 2 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene. The F508del mutation is the most common mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene, found in more than 80% of people of Northern European descent with cystic fibrosis.

# Short-acting beta 2 agonists (SABA) (salbutamol and terbutaline): reminder of the risks from overuse in asthma and to be aware of changes in the SABA prescribing guidelines

Healthcare professionals and patients are reminded of the risk of severe asthma attacks and increased mortality associated with overuse of SABA with or without anti-inflammatory maintenance therapy in patients with asthma. Healthcare professionals should be aware of the change in guidance that no longer recommends prescribing SABA without an inhaled corticosteroid.

24 April 2025



## Advice for Healthcare Professionals:

- excessive use of SABA to relieve acute asthma symptoms may mask progression of the underlying disease and contribute to an increased risk of severe and potentially life-threatening asthma exacerbations
- do not prescribe SABA to people of any age with asthma without a concomitant prescription of an inhaled corticosteroid (see Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN) NICE guideline \[NG245\], 2024)
- ensure all patients with asthma receive optimal anti-inflammatory maintenance therapy even when their asthma is well controlled and that treatment is individualised to the patient
- review and adjust asthma treatment in patients who take more than twice weekly “as needed” SABA
- urgently review patients where there has either been an increase in the number of prescriptions requested for SABA reliever inhalers or a failure to collect prescribed anti-inflammatory maintenance treatment
- anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy and maintenance and reliever therapy (MART) are recommended alternatives for people over 12 years of age with poorly controlled asthma[\[footnote 1\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/short-acting-beta-2-agonists-saba-salbutamol-and-terbutaline-reminder-of-the-risks-from-overuse-in-asthma-and-to-be-aware-of-changes-in-the-saba-prescribing-guidelines#fn:1)
- report suspected adverse drug reactions via the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)

## Advice for Healthcare Professionals to Provide to Patients:

- seek urgent medical assistance if worsening asthma symptoms (for example, chest tightness, wheezing, coughing, or difficulty breathing) are not relieved by using the asthma reliever medicines prescribed by a healthcare professional to be used during an asthma attack
- if a blue inhaler is prescribed as the asthma reliever medication to be used during an asthma attack, a separate asthma preventer therapy will always be prescribed for regular daily use as well
- use the asthma anti-inflammatory maintenance medication as prescribed by a healthcare professional even when asthma is well-controlled and the blue inhaler is rarely or never needed
- if the blue inhaler does not have a dose counter, manually track the doses used and ensure you always have access to a spare inhaler before your current inhaler runs out or expires
- follow your agreed asthma plan if you have one or ask your healthcare professional for an asthma review if the prescribed asthma blue reliever inhaler is needed more than twice a week
- your healthcare professional can provide advice on recommended alternative treatments (to the blue inhaler) for people over 12 years of age with poorly controlled asthma
- report suspected adverse drug reactions to the [Yellow Card scheme](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard)

## Background

The asthma reliever medications salbutamol and terbutaline are prescription-only SABA medications used to treat breathing problems in people with asthma and similar conditions.

Prior to December 2024, inhaled SABA was recommended to be used as required as reliever therapy for people with symptomatic asthma. In a small minority of people with asthma with infrequent, short-lived wheeze, and normal lung function, occasional use of inhaled SABA reliever therapy was considered as potentially the only treatment needed to manage their symptoms.

#### Updates to SABA product information

A review of the risk of SABA overuse was initiated in the UK by the MHRA and in the EU by the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) in 2022. The evidence reviewed included published observational data from 187,675 UK primary care electronic health care records from patients with asthma aged 12 years and over as well as similar data from other participating countries[\[footnote 3\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/short-acting-beta-2-agonists-saba-salbutamol-and-terbutaline-reminder-of-the-risks-from-overuse-in-asthma-and-to-be-aware-of-changes-in-the-saba-prescribing-guidelines#fn:3). An association was identified in the UK across all asthma severities between having 3 or more SABA prescriptions over the 1-year study period and experiencing severe asthma exacerbations. This association was independent of the use of anti-inflammatory maintenance asthma therapy.

Based on the findings of the review[\[footnote 4\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/short-acting-beta-2-agonists-saba-salbutamol-and-terbutaline-reminder-of-the-risks-from-overuse-in-asthma-and-to-be-aware-of-changes-in-the-saba-prescribing-guidelines#fn:4),[\[footnote 5\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/short-acting-beta-2-agonists-saba-salbutamol-and-terbutaline-reminder-of-the-risks-from-overuse-in-asthma-and-to-be-aware-of-changes-in-the-saba-prescribing-guidelines#fn:5), regulatory action was taken in 2023 to strengthen the warnings in the approved UK product information for SABA medications on the risk of masking asthma deterioration by overuse of SABA relievers.[\[footnote 6\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/short-acting-beta-2-agonists-saba-salbutamol-and-terbutaline-reminder-of-the-risks-from-overuse-in-asthma-and-to-be-aware-of-changes-in-the-saba-prescribing-guidelines#fn:6),[\[footnote 7\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/short-acting-beta-2-agonists-saba-salbutamol-and-terbutaline-reminder-of-the-risks-from-overuse-in-asthma-and-to-be-aware-of-changes-in-the-saba-prescribing-guidelines#fn:7)

Advice was also included

- on the importance of regular use of preventer medication even when asthma is well controlled and when a reliever inhaler is rarely needed
- recommending that patients seek medical attention as soon as possible if their use of a SABA reliever inhaler increases. This is to ensure timely re-evaluation of asthma treatment.

#### Updates to the UK asthma guidelines 2024[\[footnote 1\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/short-acting-beta-2-agonists-saba-salbutamol-and-terbutaline-reminder-of-the-risks-from-overuse-in-asthma-and-to-be-aware-of-changes-in-the-saba-prescribing-guidelines\#fn:1),[\[footnote 2\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/short-acting-beta-2-agonists-saba-salbutamol-and-terbutaline-reminder-of-the-risks-from-overuse-in-asthma-and-to-be-aware-of-changes-in-the-saba-prescribing-guidelines\#fn:2)

The [UK asthma guidelines](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/recommendations#principles-of-pharmacological-treatment)[\[footnote 1\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/short-acting-beta-2-agonists-saba-salbutamol-and-terbutaline-reminder-of-the-risks-from-overuse-in-asthma-and-to-be-aware-of-changes-in-the-saba-prescribing-guidelines#fn:1) were updated in November 2024 following a review of the evidence from multiple sources including national reviews of asthma deaths in both adults and children. The evidence highlighted that clinical outcomes with asthma were poorest in all age groups when using SABA alone. SABA overuse was associated with an increased risk of severe asthma exacerbations, hospitalisations and mortality irrespective of asthma severity or co-administration of anti-inflammatory therapy. As a result, in accordance with the updated UK asthma guidelines, the prescribing of inhaled SABA monotherapy for people of any age with asthma without prescribing a concomitant approved asthma preventer anti-inflammatory medication is no longer recommended. The guidance now recommends that the majority of people with asthma should be controlled on either AIR or MART treatment without the need for SABA. The personalised asthma action plan should be reviewed at every asthma review to ensure pharmacological treatment is optimised if asthma control is suboptimal.

#### National Child Mortality Database report[\[footnote 8\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/short-acting-beta-2-agonists-saba-salbutamol-and-terbutaline-reminder-of-the-risks-from-overuse-in-asthma-and-to-be-aware-of-changes-in-the-saba-prescribing-guidelines\#fn:8)

A report was published in December 2024 by the UK National Child Mortality Database Programme on child deaths which occurred between April 2019 and March 2023 due to asthma or anaphylaxis. The findings confirmed previous evidence on the risks associated with overuse of SABA. Of the 54 child deaths due to asthma which were identified, 87% (47) had an excessive number of reliever inhalers (three or more) dispensed in the year before their death, with 27 children (50%) having 12 or more reliever inhalers dispensed. Furthermore, for 35 (65%) children, there was insufficient dispensing of preventer inhalers with fewer than 9 dispensed in the year preceding their death, and 23 (43%) children receiving 4 or fewer preventer inhalers.

# Fezolinetant▼(Veoza): risk of liver injury; new recommendations to minimise risk

Fezolinetant treatment is associated with a risk of drug induced liver injury. New recommendations have been introduced to minimise this risk. Liver function should be monitored before and during treatment in all patients taking fezolinetant. Fezolinetant should be avoided in patients with known liver disease or at a higher risk of liver disease.

10 April 2025



## Advice for Healthcare Professionals:

- cases of serious liver injury with elevated transaminases, bilirubin and signs and symptoms of hepatic dysfunction have been reported during treatment with fezolinetant. These were generally reversible on discontinuation of therapy
- avoid fezolinetant in patients with known liver disease or patients at higher risk for liver disease
- treatment with fezolinetant must not be initiated if serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels are ≥2x the upper limit of normal or if total bilirubin levels are ≥2x the upper limit of normal
- treatment with fezolinetant must be discontinued if:
  - transaminase elevations are ≥3x the upper limit of normal with:
     total bilirubin >2x the upper limit of normal OR if patients develop symptoms of liver injury
  - transaminase elevations >5x the upper limit of normal
- perform liver function tests, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and serum bilirubin (total and direct), prior to treatment initiation, monthly during the first 3 months of treatment and periodically thereafter based on clinical judgment
- liver function tests must also be performed when signs or symptoms suggestive of liver injury occur
- monitoring should be maintained until liver function tests have normalised
- patients should be advised to seek immediate medical attention if they develop any sign or symptoms of liver injury, including fatigue, pruritus, jaundice, dark urine, pale faeces, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite and/or abdominal pain
- a Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) has been disseminated alongside this Drug Safety Update
- report suspected adverse drug reactions associated with fezolinetant via the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)

## Advice for Healthcare Professionals to Provide to Patients:

- fezolinetant is used for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, including hot flushes and night sweats, associated with the menopause
- there have been cases of liver problems in people taking fezolinetant, which were generally reversible following discontinuation of treatment
- all patients will now have their liver function tested before and during treatment
- you will have a blood test to check your liver function before you start taking fezolinetant. This will be repeated monthly during the first 3 months of treatment and then afterwards depending on when your doctor deems appropriate
- seek medical attention immediately if you develop symptoms suggesting a problem with your liver. These include tiredness, itching, yellowing of the skin and eyes, dark urine, light-coloured stools, feeling or being sick, loss of appetite or stomach pain
- always read the leaflet that is provided alongside your medicine, which contains information about taking fezolinetant and a full list of known possible side effects
- report suspected adverse drug reactions to the [Yellow Card scheme](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard)

## Background

### Fezolinetant and liver injury

Fezolinetant is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause. It is a nonhormonal selective neurokinin (NK) 3 receptor antagonist that blocks NKB binding on the KNDy neuron to modulate neuronal activity in the thermoregulatory centre.

The current product information contains information relating to ALT and AST elevations which were seen in clinical trials, and monitoring for some patients has been advised since its authorisation.

A recent European review of safety data identified 3 cases where ALT and/or AST elevations were accompanied by an increase in bilirubin and 12 cases where rises in transaminases were accompanied by additional signs and symptoms of liver injury such as pale stool, itching of palms and soles, abdominal pain and dark urine.

It is not possible to estimate the frequency of reports of liver injury or bilirubin elevations. Elevated ALT and AST are listed as common side effects meaning this occurs in more than 1 in 100 people but less than 1 in 10. The mechanism underlying liver injury following treatment is unknown.

In the UK, from December 2023 to January 2025 the Yellow Card scheme has received one spontaneous report of abnormal liver test results associated with fezolinetant; no spontaneous reports have been received for liver disorders.

Fezolinetant is currently only available through a private prescription.

As for all medicines, the MHRA will keep reports of suspected adverse drug reactions under close review.

### New advice to minimise risk of liver injury

Following the findings of the European review, existing warnings on hepatotoxicity in the product information for fezolinetant have been strengthened. A recommendation has been added to perform liver function tests prior to treatment initiation, monthly for the first 3 months and periodically thereafter based on clinical judgment. Fezolinetant should be avoided in patients with a known liver condition or patients at higher risk for liver disease. A Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) has been published.

### Advice in cases of liver enzyme abnormalities

Elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and symptoms suggestive of liver injury were generally reversible on discontinuation of therapy.

Treatment should not be started if ALT and/or AST is ≥2x equal to or greater than two times the amount of upper limit of normal (ULN) or if total bilirubin is elevated for example bilirubin that is equal to or greater than two times the total amount of ULN (≥2x ULN).

Treatment should be stopped if liver injury is suspected, or if there is evidence of deranged liver function tests and monitoring of liver enzymes should be maintained until they have normalised.

# Prolonged-release opioids: Removal of indication for relief of post-operative pain

The indication for the treatment of post-operative pain has been removed from the licences of all prolonged release opioids due to the increased risk of persistent post-operative opioid use (PPOU) and opioid-induced ventilatory impairment (OIVI).

From:[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency)Published12 March 2025

Therapeutic area:[Anaesthesia and intensive care](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=anaesthesia-intensive-care) and [Pain management and palliation](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=pain-management-palliation)Published:
12 March 2025



It is not recommended to use transdermal patches for the treatment of post-operative pain.

## Advice for Healthcare Professionals:

- prolonged-release opioids provide relief from chronic severe pain, however, they should not be used for the treatment of acute pain following surgery
- prolonged-release opioids are associated with an increased risk of PPOU characterised as continued opioid use beyond 90 days following the operation, and an increased risk of OIVI causing serious respiratory depression, sedation, and depression of upper airway muscle tone
- before surgery, discuss with the patient the following:
  - explain the risks of PPOU, dependence and potential risk of addiction and withdrawal reactions
  - explain the risk of OIVI especially for patients with underlying respiratory conditions
  - immediate-release opioids are used for short-term treatment of pain
  - discuss with the patient pain management strategies involving the use of immediate-release opioids and multimodal analgesia and plan for end of treatment
- patients whose pain is managed with opioids pre-operatively should have their treatment reviewed before and after surgery in line with [Consensus Best Practice Guidelines](https://www.cpoc.org.uk/sites/cpoc/files/documents/2021-03/surgery-and-opioids-2021.pdf)
- at discharge from hospital:
  - only prescribe and supply a sufficient amount of immediate-release opioids to treat acute post-operative pain to minimise the risk of PPOU, dependence, stock piling of unused opioids and potential for diversion
  - communicate the pain management plan with the primary care practice taking over care in the community and document in patient clinical notes
- it is important to report suspected dependence or respiratory depression to any medicine, including an opioid, via the [Yellow Card Scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)

## Advice for Healthcare Professionals to Provide to Patients:

- opioids provide relief from moderate to severe pain. Pain following an operation is usually short-lived and therefore should only require short-term treatment
- immediate release opioids are used for the treatment of short-term post-operative pain
- if you are taking prolonged release opioids before going into hospital for an operation, talk to your doctor to discuss your pain management and ongoing needs
- there is a greater risk of respiratory depression (problems breathing) and persistent post-operative opioid use with prolonged release opioids
- if you notice new or increased trouble with your breathing, dial 999 as this could be a sign of respiratory depression
- if you feel like you cannot stop taking opioids as you had originally planned, contact your doctor as this could be a sign of persistent post-operative opioid use (PPOU)
- if you are concerned for someone who has been using more opioids than prescribed, you can also seek advice from the [NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/pain/how-to-get-nhs-help-for-your-pain/) or if you are in Northern Ireland from the [Health and Social Care website](https://online.hscni.net/our-work/pharmacy-and-medicines-management/patient-initiatives/long-term-pain/)

## Background

### Review of the benefits and risks of prolonged release opioids after surgery

Prolonged-release (modified release) opioids are indicated for moderate or severe pain and cancer pain, although NICE guidance \[ [NG193](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng193/chapter/Recommendations#managing-chronic-primary-pain)\] recommends that opioids are not used for chronic primary pain where there is no underlying condition accounting for the pain. A small number of prolonged release opioids containing morphine or oxycodone were also authorised for the treatment of post-operative pain, however concerns were raised on the potential for harm and an increased risk of PPOU and OIVI.

PPOU is defined as continued opioid use beyond 90 days from the day of operation. Dependence is a well-known side effect of opioids and we continue to communicate to raise awareness on this issue ( [see Drug Safety Update on opioids: risk of dependence and addiction](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/opioids-risk-of-dependence-and-addiction)).

Evidence from across the EU including the UK has shown that the incidence of PPOU ranges from 2% - 44% in patients treated with prolonged-release opioids. Also PPOU is more prevalent (incidence up to 60%) in patients taking prolonged-release opioids pre-operatively.

Respiratory depression is also a well-known side effect of opioids, especially if taken in excess or in combination with other sedating medicines (for example [benzodiazepines](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/benzodiazepines-and-opioids-reminder-of-risk-of-potentially-fatal-respiratory-depression), [pregabalin](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/pregabalin-lyrica-reports-of-severe-respiratory-depression) or [gabapentin](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/gabapentin-neurontin-risk-of-severe-respiratory-depression)) which can lead to coma and potentially death.

OIVI is a serious form of respiratory depression associated with:

- depression of respiratory rate and/or depth of breathing – ‘central respiratory depression’
- depression of consciousness – ‘sedation’
- depression of supraglottic airway muscle tone – ‘upper airway obstruction’

The reported incidence of OIVI is difficult to determine, although the international multidisciplinary consensus statement quotes an incidence of OIVI ranging from 0.4% to 41% depending on the identification measures used.

Following the conclusion of a safety review undertaken by the MHRA, and advice from the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM), the indication for the treatment of post-operative pain will be removed from the licences of prolonged release morphine and prolonged release oxycodone. The remaining prolonged release opioids are not recommended for acute post-operative pain relief and may already not be indicated for acute use or are contraindicated in acute pain relief.

The information considered by the CHM and the advice issued is presented in a [Public Assessment Report.](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/modified-release-opioids-and-treatment-of-post-operative-pain)

### Post-operative pain prescribing recommendations

Pain following surgery is usually short-lived, lasting between 5 – 7 days and therefore should only require short-term pain management best treated with immediate release opioids. However, many patients are discharged from hospitals with excessive amounts of opioids to meet their needs for acute post-operative pain management. This excess supply of opioids increases the risk of developing PPOU, dependence, addiction, or could lead to opioid diversion, and an increased risk of OIVI with unmanaged use. Therefore, patients should only be provided with a prescription for a sufficient amount of instant release opioids to manage their acute post-operative pain on discharge from hospital.

A [Consensus Best Practice Guideline](https://www.cpoc.org.uk/sites/cpoc/files/documents/2021-03/surgery-and-opioids-2021.pdf) agreed between the Faculty of Pain Medicine, Royal College of Anaesthetists, Royal College of General Practitioners, Royal College of Surgeons of England, Royal College of Nursing, The British Pain Society, the Centre for Perioperative Care and endorsed by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, recommend that pre-operative use of opioids should be reviewed prior to surgery.

### Patients at increased risk

Adjustments in dose or dosing regimen might be necessary in patients at increased risk of experiencing these severe adverse reactions, including patients:

- with compromised respiratory function or respiratory disease
- with neurological disease
- with renal impairment
- with cardiovascular disorders
- using concomitant central nervous system (CNS) depressants
- older than 65 years
- with opioid tolerance
- using opioids pre-operatively

Patients and healthcare professionals are encouraged to discuss treatment regimens and agree a post-operative pain management plan prior to the proposed surgical procedure.

## Reporting advice

If a patient experiences any side effect or is recognised by the prescriber to be experiencing a side effect related to post-operative analgesia to a medicine, prescribers, patients, or carers are asked to report this to the MHRA through:

- the [Yellow Card website](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/).
- the Yellow Card app; download from the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id990237487?pt=117756671&ct=EYC&mt=8) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.mhra.yellowcard&referrer=utm_source%3DEYC%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26anid%3Dadmob)
- some clinical IT systems for healthcare professionals (EMIS, SystmOne, Vision, MiDatabank, and Ulysses)

This will assist the MHRA to monitor the rates reported in the UK and therefore to further protect public health.

When reporting suspected adverse drug reactions, please provide as much information as possible, including information about medical history, any concomitant medication, onset timing, and treatment dates.

## Post-publication note - June 2025

In June 2025, the safety and educational materials for valproate were updated in line with the regulatory position and to reflect feedback from stakeholders. Please find the latest materials in our [June 2025 Drug Safety Update](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/valproate-belvo-convulex-depakote-dyzantil-epilim-epilim-chrono-or-chronosphere-episenta-epival-and-syonellv-updated-safety-and-educational-materials-to-support-patient-discussion-on-reproductive-risks).

## Advice for Healthcare Professionals:

- the CHM has advised that a review by two specialists is required for initiating valproate in patients under 55 years of age but not for men who are already taking valproate
- three infographics have been produced to clarify in which situations review by two specialists may be required:
  - [for female patients under 55 years old](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/67adf28c6e6c8d18118acd69/250213_MHRA_Valproate_Infographic_Female_under_55_CC_V7.pdf)
  - [for male patients under 55 years old](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/67adf2aa6e6c8d18118acd6a/250213_MHRA_Valproate_Infographic_Male_under_55_CC_V7.pdf)
  - [for male and female patients 55 years and older](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/67adf2c62c594609b38acd71/250213_MHRA_Valproate_Infographic_55_or_older_CC_V7.pdf)
- a list of who might qualify as a specialist can be found at [Valproate safety measures](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/valproate-safety-measures)
- report suspected adverse reactions associated with valproate on [Yellow Card](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)

## Reminder of previous advice for healthcare professionals:

### Patients under 55 years of age starting valproate

- valproate must not be started in new patients (male or female) younger than 55 years unless two specialists independently consider and document that there is no other effective or tolerated treatment, or there are compelling reasons that the reproductive risks do not apply. For many patients, other effective treatment options are available to treat their bipolar disorder or epilepsy
- information on permanent reasons or compelling reasons as to why the reproductive risks may not apply to a patient may be sought from [clinical guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/valproate-use-by-women-and-girls#clinical-resources)

### Women and girls of childbearing potential currently taking valproate

- at their next annual specialist review, women and girls of childbearing potential receiving valproate should have their treatment reviewed using the revised Annual Risk Acknowledgement Form. At this review, if the patient has never been reviewed by two specialists either at initiation or annual review, a second specialist signature will be needed if the patient is to continue on valproate. Women do not need to be recalled for an additional review. Once a patient has received a treatment review by two specialists, subsequent annual reviews only require one specialist

### Men currently taking valproate

- as a precaution, recommend that male patients and their female sexual partner use effective contraception (condoms, plus effective contraception used by female sexual partner) throughout the valproate treatment period and for 3 months after stopping valproate, to allow for one completed sperm cycle not exposed to valproate
- at their next regular treatment review, discuss with men on oral valproate treatment whether they are planning to father a child in the next year and if they are, refer to a specialist to discuss most appropriate treatment options
- advise men not to donate sperm during valproate treatment and for 3 months after stopping valproate
- if a female reports they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy with a man on valproate, refer them for prenatal counselling

## Advice for Healthcare Professionals to Provide to Patients:

- do not stop taking valproate without advice from a specialist. This is because epilepsy or bipolar disorder may worsen without treatment
- if you are on valproate, please attend any offered appointments to discuss your treatment and talk to a healthcare professional if you are concerned
- if you wish to discuss family planning, please contact a healthcare professional

## Background

### Valproate treatment and reproductive risks

Valproate (as sodium valproate, valproic acid or valproate semisodium) is authorised for the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder. Valproate is known to have potential risks of major congenital malformations or neurodevelopmental disorders in children when mothers take valproate during pregnancy. More recently, the risk of a range of neurodevelopmental disorders in children born to fathers taking valproate compared to other antiseizures medicines has been described.

Studies have shown that the use of valproate during pregnancy is associated with risks of physical defects, in around 1 in 9 babies exposed, and neurodevelopmental disorders, in around 3-4 in 10 babies when mothers use valproate in pregnancy. There is a much lower potential risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, in around 5 in 100 babies when fathers take valproate in the 3 months before conception. Additional reproductive risks of valproate in male patients include infertility in humans and evidence of testicular toxicity in animals.

In 2022, the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) reviewed the latest data on the reproductive risks with valproate. Their advice was communicated in [Drug Safety Update December 2022](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/valproate-reminder-of-current-pregnancy-prevention-programme-requirements-information-on-new-safety-measures-to-be-introduced-in-the-coming-months). The CHM formed an implementation group to advise on the safe introduction of the new measures into clinical practice.

The measures were applied first to all new patients under 55 years old and women of childbearing potential already under specialist review. The [National Patient Safety Alert](https://www.gov.uk/drug-device-alerts/national-patient-safety-alert-valproate-organisations-to-prepare-for-new-regulatory-measures-for-oversight-of-prescribing-to-new-patients-and-existing-female-patients-natpsa-slash-2023-slash-013-slash-mhra) on 28 November 2023 and [Drug Safety Update January 2024](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/valproate-belvo-convulex-depakote-dyzantil-epilim-epilim-chrono-or-chronosphere-episenta-epival-and-syonellv-new-safety-and-educational-materials-to-support-regulatory-measures-in-men-and-women-under-55-years-of-age) provided further advice on the implementation of these requirements.

No requirement for specialist review of men currently taking valproate was introduced at this time unless the male patient was planning to father a child. The CHM recommended that any further measures should consider advice from healthcare professionals and patients developed in light of experience with the initial phase.

### Recent review and updated advice

Review by two specialists remains in place for all patients initiating valproate under 55 years of age but the CHM has advised that it will not be required for men (or males) currently taking valproate. Given the recent recommendations in [Drug Safety Update September 2024](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/valproate-use-in-men-as-a-precaution-men-and-their-partners-should-use-effective-contraception), the CHM advised that there is already sufficient risk minimisation in place for this patient group but that this position should be kept under review. In addition to the Drug Safety Update September 2024, further information on the reproductive risks for males can be found in a [Public Assessment Report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/valproate-review-of-safety-data-and-expert-advice-on-management-of-risks) published in November 2023. Any patient wishing to change their medication should be referred to a specialist.

The information considered by CHM and the advice issued is presented in a [Public Assessment Report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/valproate-managing-reproductive-risks-in-male-patients-under-55).

Three infographics have been produced to clarify in which instances two specialist review may be required:

- [for female patients under 55 years old](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/67adf28c6e6c8d18118acd69/250213_MHRA_Valproate_Infographic_Female_under_55_CC_V7.pdf)

- [for male and female patients 55 years and older](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/67adf2c62c594609b38acd71/250213_MHRA_Valproate_Infographic_55_or_older_CC_V7.pdf)

### Reporting advice

Healthcare professionals, patients, and caregivers are asked to submit reports using the Yellow Card scheme electronically using:

- the [Yellow Card website](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/).
- the Yellow Card app; download from the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id990237487?pt=117756671&ct=EYC&mt=8) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.mhra.yellowcard&referrer=utm_source%3DEYC%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26anid%3Dadmob)
- some clinical IT systems for healthcare professionals (EMIS, SystmOne, Vision, MiDatabank, and Ulysses)

When reporting suspected adverse drug reactions, please provide as much information as possible, including information about medical history, any concomitant medication, onset timing, and treatment dates.

# GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists: potential risk of pulmonary aspiration during general anaesthesia or deep sedation

Healthcare professionals should be aware of the potential risk of pulmonary aspiration in patients using GLP-1 or dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists who undergo surgery or procedures with general anaesthesia or deep sedation.

From:[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency)Published28 January 2025

Therapeutic area:[Anaesthesia and intensive care](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=anaesthesia-intensive-care), [Cardiovascular disease and lipidology](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=cardiovascular-disease-lipidology), [Endocrinology, diabetology and metabolism](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=endocrinology-diabetology-metabolism) and [Nutrition and dietetics](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=nutrition-dietetics)Published:

GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists are known to cause delayed gastric emptying, which may increase the risk of residual gastric contents despite preoperative fasting.

## Advice for healthcare professionals:

- glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as the dual agonist tirzepatide, are known to slow gastric emptying, which is a recognised side effect of these medicines
- consider that patients taking these medicines who are undergoing surgeries or procedures with general anaesthesia or deep sedation may have residual gastric contents despite preoperative fasting
- anaesthetists should consider the potential risk of aspiration within their risk assessment of patients being treated with GLP-1 or dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists for all indications and manage the aspiration risk, in line with usual anaesthetic practice
- anaesthetists should provide an individualised assessment of the aspiration risk. Within the risk assessment, consider the following points:
  - that patients taking GLP-1 or dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists who have underlying diabetic gastroparesis, as well as other comorbidities such as obesity or gastroesophageal reflux disease, and symptoms of delayed gastric emptying (such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain) may be at higher risk of aspiration
  - patients should be asked about whether they are taking GLP-1 or dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists. Consider the possibility that patients may have purchased GLP-1 or dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists for aesthetic weight loss and may not readily disclose this information unless directly asked. Be aware that private prescriptions may not always be included in the patient’s medical notes or drug history
- healthcare professionals should identify the increased risk of aspiration as early as possible before surgery and specifically at pre-assessment clinic before surgery
- remind patients to inform their healthcare teams and anaesthetists if they are on GLP-1 or dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists
- report suspected adverse drug reactions associated with GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists, aspiration and other surgical complications on a [Yellow Card](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard)

## Advice for healthcare professionals to provide to patients:

- if you are taking a GLP-1 or dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist, make sure you inform your healthcare team including the anaesthetist about this prior to your surgical procedure
- this medicine slows the emptying of your stomach, increasing the risk that stomach contents (e.g. food and drink) could enter into your airways and lungs during surgery or procedures whilst you are under general anaesthesia or deep sedation. This means that a modification to the pre-procedure instruction and anaesthetic technique may be required
- take your prescribed medicine(s) as usual and do not stop your treatment without first discussing this with your doctor

## Review of the risk of aspiration associated with GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor treatment

GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists are a class of medications that are used to treat type II diabetes mellitus and/or obesity. The GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists available in the UK include dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, lixisenatide, semaglutide. Tirzepatide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist combined with glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonist. Semaglutide is also approved to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with established cardiovascular disease.

Some of the GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists have more than one brand name and more than one indication. Please refer to [Annex 1](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/671912baa36621334536b39d/Annex_1_GLP-1RA-containing_medicines.pdf) for the GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1  receptor agonist products currently authorised in the UK with their brand names and indications.

Residual gastric content is a risk factor for aspiration in patients who undergo surgery or procedures with general anaesthesia or deep sedation. All GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists slow down gastric emptying, therefore patients taking these medicines may have a higher risk of pulmonary aspiration due to retained gastric contents. This can potentially lead to severe complications, such as aspiration pneumonia. Cases have been reported in the literature as well as through Yellow Card reports.

A [recent European review](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/prac-recommendation/prac-recommendations-signals-adopted-8-11-july-2024-prac-meeting_en.pdf) of the available evidence for all GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists concluded that the data supports an association between GLP-1 or dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists and the potential risk of pulmonary aspiration during anaesthesia or deep sedation because of the delayed gastric emptying associated with these medicines. The findings of this review were considered by the Pharmacovigilance Expert Advisory Committee (PEAG) of the [Commission on Human Medicines](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/commission-on-human-medicines/about/membership) (CHM), which agreed with the recommendations. The product information of all GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists has been updated to include the potential risk of pulmonary aspiration under general anaesthesia or deep sedation.

The PEAG recommended that the MHRA inform healthcare professionals and patients of the possibility of aspiration in patients using GLP-1 or dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists who undergo surgery or procedures requiring general anaesthesia or deep sedation.

The European assessment evaluated whether a specific time to pause the use of a GLP-1 or dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist prior to anaesthesia could be recommended, as well recommending new fasting guidelines or an appropriate medical procedure to confirm an empty stomach. The evidence to support further recommendations was limited and it was concluded that anaesthetists should retain the flexibility to provide individualised assessment.

## Product information update

New warnings have been added to the Summaries of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Patient Information Leaflets. The new advice aims to raise awareness of the risk of pulmonary aspiration amongst healthcare professionals and patients. Anaesthetists are warned that residual gastric contents may remain despite routine recommended fasting in patients taking a GLP-1 or dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists. This should be considered within the preoperative risk assessment, with subsequent management in preventing or minimising the risk.

## UK Yellow Cards

As of 12 December 2024, the MHRA has received a very small number of reports of aspiration during a surgical procedure associated with GLP-1 or dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists, including one case that resulted in aspiration pneumonia.

## Clinical Guidelines

In January 2025, the Association of Anaesthetists published a multidisciplinary consensus statement on [‘Elective peri-operative management of adults taking glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1). Association of Anaesthetists’](https://associationofanaesthetists-publications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/anae.16541)  which advises taking the GLP-1 or dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist as normal (irrespective of dosing schedule i.e. daily or weekly).

The UK SmPCs for all GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist products does not provide guidance on withholding these medications before surgery or procedures requiring general anaesthesia or deep sedation.

## Reporting Advice

Please continue to report suspected adverse drug reactions to the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/). Healthcare professionals, patients, and caregivers are asked to submit reports using the Yellow Card scheme electronically using:

- the [Yellow Card website](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)
- the Yellow Card app; download from the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id990237487?pt=117756671&ct=EYC&mt=8) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.mhra.yellowcard&referrer=utm_source%3DEYC%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26anid%3Dadmob)
- some clinical IT systems for healthcare professionals (EMIS, SystmOne, Vision, MiDatabank, and Ulysses)

When reporting please provide as much information as possible, including information about batch numbers, medical history, any concomitant medication, onset timing, treatment dates, and product brand name.

For queries or more information, please contact [info@mhra.gov.uk](mailto:info@mhra.gov.uk)

The theme for [this campaign](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/MedSafetyWeek) is ‘preventing side effects’, focusing on the importance of using healthcare products in the right way to prevent harm and reporting suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to medicines and suspected adverse incidents with medical devices.

We ask healthcare professionals to support the campaign and talk to their patients and colleagues about side effects and how to report suspected safety concerns to the Yellow Card scheme.

## What healthcare professionals can do to support MedSafetyWeek – 4 to 10 November 2024:

- follow the MHRA social media channels and show your support for this year’s MedSafetyWeek by reposting, commenting, liking and sharing material with your social media contacts using #MHRAyellowcard, #MedSafetyWeek, #ReportSideEffects and #patientsafety
- we ask that you report suspected ADRs (side effects) to medicines to the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/) or via the Yellow Card app (download from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id990237487) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.mhra.yellowcard&referrer=utm_source%3DEYC%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26anid%3Dadmob))
- please also report ADRs where harm occurs due to adverse incidents with medical devices (including software, apps and artificial intelligence), safety concerns about e-cigarettes and their refill containers (e-liquids), adverse reactions to herbal or homeopathic medicines and defective, low-quality or falsified (fake) healthcare products
- adverse drug reactions where harm occurs as a result of a medication error are reportable as a Yellow Card or through the local risk management systems into the [Learn from Patient Safety Events (LFPSE) service](https://www.england.nhs.uk/patient-safety/patient-safety-insight/learning-from-patient-safety-events/learn-from-patient-safety-events-service/). If reported to the LFPSE, these will be shared with the MHRA. If the LFPSE is not available and harm occurs, please report [using a Yellow Card](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)
- to ensure the use of medicines in the right way to prevent harm, we remind you to discuss with your patients:
  - the importance of taking the right medicine, at the right time, in the right way and at the right dose and of carefully following instructions for use of medical devices
  - the importance of reading the Patient Information Leaflet that comes with a medicine or vaccine
  - what to do if patients experience problems with a healthcare product, such as contacting a healthcare professional and self-reporting to the Yellow Card scheme. For patients using continuous glucose monitors or insulin pumps for diabetes management, highlight our [available guidance on reporting to the Yellow Card scheme](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-safety-concerns-with-insulin-pumps-and-continuous-glucose-monitoring-equipment)
- please do talk to your colleagues about staying vigilant for suspected adverse reactions to medicines or vaccines, especially new, serious or rare reactions, those that may have a delayed onset or any medication interactions. Emphasise the importance of reporting these to the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)

## About MedSafetyWeek

MedSafetyWeek, an annual event, forms part of international efforts to raise awareness about the importance of reporting suspected adverse reactions to national medicines regulatory authorities, such as the MHRA. This year, regulators from 94 countries and 107 organisations will take part across the globe.

The theme for 2024’s campaign is ‘preventing side effects’, aligning with the third [World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Patient Safety Challenge: Medication Without Harm](https://www.who.int/initiatives/medication-without-harm).[\[footnote 1\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/medsafetyweek-november-2024-your-yellow-card-report-helps-prevent-future-harm-to-others-and-improves-patient-safety#fn:1) Preventable ADRs contribute significantly to an increasing burden on patients and healthcare services with associated admissions contributing to morbidity and mortality.[\[footnote 2\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/medsafetyweek-november-2024-your-yellow-card-report-helps-prevent-future-harm-to-others-and-improves-patient-safety#fn:2) Epidemiological studies have consistently shown that between one third and a half of all ADRs may be potentially preventable.[\[footnote 3\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/medsafetyweek-november-2024-your-yellow-card-report-helps-prevent-future-harm-to-others-and-improves-patient-safety#fn:3)

Anticipating and managing ADRs is key to reducing this burden and protecting patients from avoidable harm. Importantly, Yellow Card reports help to identify previously unknown ADRs and provide new safety knowledge to inform risk minimisation measures. Every report counts to strengthen healthcare product vigilance.

**Before using healthcare products, it is good practice to follow the adapted WHO guidance [Know, Check, Inform, and Ask](https://www.who.int/initiatives/medication-without-harm/campaign-materials):**

- Know: the healthcare product
- Check you have the right: patient, medicine, route, dose, time
- Inform: your patient about the healthcare product, discuss potential side effects and what to do if they experience any; this includes reporting any suspected problems using the Yellow Card scheme
- Ask: your patient if they understand

More information about the global MedSafetyWeek campaign is available on the [Uppsala Monitoring Centre’s website](https://who-umc.org/medsafetyweek/).

## About Yellow Card reports

The Yellow Card scheme helps us to monitor the safety of healthcare products once they are on the market. Reporting to the scheme allows the MHRA to identify new adverse effects and gain more information about known adverse effects. By completing a Yellow Card report, you help contribute to the safe use of healthcare products for patients.

We ask that you report suspected ADRs to a medicine or vaccine directly to the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/) as soon as they arise. Please also report adverse incidents to medical devices on a Yellow Card; if you are in Scotland or Northern Ireland report via your [local reporting systems](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-yellow-card-scheme-guidance-for-healthcare-professionals#medical-devices-adverse-incidents). More information on reporting [potential problems with medical devices](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/managing-medical-devices) is available.

It is particularly important that all suspected adverse reactions involving [Black Triangle (▼) medicines](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-yellow-card-scheme-guidance-for-healthcare-professionals#black-triangle-scheme) are reported. Yellow Card reports can also be made for products such as blood factors and immunoglobulin products. Read more about the [different types of Yellow Card reports](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/resources/reporttypes).

The Yellow Card scheme has helped to identify numerous safety issues, many of which were not previously linked to a particular healthcare product until Yellow Card reports were received by the MHRA. Read our [case studies describing how Yellow Card reports have contributed to patient safety](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/casestudies).

## We need your help with the Yellow Card Biobank study

The [Yellow Card Biobank](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/biobank) is a collaboration between the MHRA and Genomics England. The goal is to improve understanding of how patients’ genetic makeup may increase their risk of experiencing adverse reactions from prescribed medications. We are looking for patients who have experienced specific side effects when taking [allopurinol](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/13158/smpc) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) to join the study, before mid-January 2025.

Side effects covered in this pilot study are:

- severe bleeding events with a DOAC - apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban – see [Drug Safety Update](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/direct-acting-oral-anticoagulants-doacs-reminder-of-bleeding-risk-including-availability-of-reversal-agents) for a reminder on this risk
- rare severe skin reactions with [allopurinol](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/13158/smpc), including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) syndrome

If you have any questions on the Biobank study, please email Yellowcardbiobank@mhra.gov.uk

## Resources for healthcare professionals

[More information](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/information) and [resources](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/resources), such as accredited e-learning modules and materials to help raise awareness locally, are available on the [Yellow Card website](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/). Links to new materials to download and print for local promotion and social media are available on the [MedSafetyWeek campaign page](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/MedSafetyWeek).

# GLP-1 receptor agonists: reminder of the potential side effects and to be aware of the potential for misuse

Healthcare professionals are reminded to inform patients about the common and serious side effects associated with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs).

From:[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency)Published24 October 2024

Therapeutic area:[Cardiovascular disease and lipidology](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=cardiovascular-disease-lipidology), [Endocrinology, diabetology and metabolism](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=endocrinology-diabetology-metabolism) and [Nutrition and dietetics](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=nutrition-dietetics)

## Advice for healthcare professionals:

- inform patients upon initial prescription and when increasing the dose about the common risk of gastrointestinal side effects which may affect more than 1 in 10 patients. These are usually non-serious, however can sometimes lead to more serious complications such as severe dehydration, resulting in hospitalisation

- be aware that hypoglycaemia can occur in non-diabetic patients using some GLP-1RAs for weight management; ensure patients are aware of the symptoms and signs of hypoglycaemia and know to urgently seek medical advice should they occur

- patients should also be warned of the [risk of falsified GLP-1RA medicines for weight loss if not prescribed by a registered healthcare professional, and be aware that some falsified medicines have been found to contain insulin](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/ozempicv-semaglutide-and-saxenda-liraglutide-vigilance-required-due-to-potentially-harmful-falsified-products)[\[footnote 1\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/glp-1-receptor-agonists-reminder-of-the-potential-side-effects-and-to-be-aware-of-the-potential-for-misuse#fn:1)

- be aware there have been reports of potential misuse of GLP-1RAs for unauthorised indications such as aesthetic weight loss

- report suspected adverse drug reactions to the [Yellow Card scheme](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard)


## Advice for healthcare professionals to provide to patients:

- GLP-1RAs are prescription-only medicines to be used under medical supervision and should only be prescribed by a registered healthcare professional

- the benefits and risks of using a GLP-1RAs for weight loss outside of the licensed indications have not been studied

- common gastrointestinal side-effects of GLP-1RAs treatment (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and constipation) can persist for several days and may affect more than 1 in 10 patients. This may result in dehydration, which if severe may lead to other serious health complications such as kidney damage resulting in hospitalisation

- throughout treatment stay well hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids (such as water) to avoid dehydration, which can sometimes occur after experiencing gastrointestinal side-effects including vomiting and diarrhoea

- other serious but less common side-effects of GLP-1RAs include acute gallstone disease, pancreatitis, and serious allergic reactions

- if obtaining a private prescription (from a non-NHS prescriber), ensure that this is dispensed from authorised sources, such as registered online pharmacies, to avoid the risk of receiving falsified pens

- carefully read the instructions for use in the Patient Information Leaflet, and use the prescribed dose

- if you are concerned about any side-effects, speak to a healthcare professional


## Background

GLP-1RAs are effective and acceptably safe treatments when used within their licensed indications. However, as with all medicines, there are risks associated with their use.

GLP-1RAs are a class of medications used to treat type II diabetes mellitus and obesity. Five GLP-1RAs are available in the UK: dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, lixisenatide, semaglutide. Wegovy, which contains semaglutide, is also licensed as a preventative treatment to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with established cardiovascular disease. Mounjaro (tirzepatide) is a GLP-1RA combined with glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor agonist (GIP RA).

Some of the GLP-1RA products have more than one brand name and more than one indication. Annex 1 lists the GLP-1RA products currently authorised in the UK with their brand names and indications.

Public interest in the use of GLP-1RA products for weight loss is high. GLP-1RA products licensed for weight reduction are effective treatment options for patients who have obesity (with a BMI above 30kg/m²) or who are overweight with weight-related comorbidities (with a BMI above 27kg/m²) such as cardiovascular disease. Saxenda (liraglutide), Wegovy (semaglutide) and Mounjaro (tirzepatide) are the only GLP-1RA products licensed for weight management.

There has been anecdotal evidence and adverse drug reaction reports suggesting misuse of GLP-1RA products for weight management by individuals outside of the licensed indication. The benefits and risks of using these medicines for weight loss by individuals who do not have obesity or who are not overweight with weight-related comorbidities have not been studied.

## Risk of adverse drug reactions associated with GLP-1RA medicines

To ensure informed decision-making when prescribing GLP-1RAs for weight management, it is important that patients are aware of the potential adverse drug reactions associated with these medicines. These include common gastrointestinal reactions, that, if not managed effectively, can lead to serious complications.

Gastrointestinal side effects are more likely to occur at the start of treatment or after a recent increase in dose. Healthcare professionals should also discuss the serious, but less common risks such as pancreatitis and gall bladder disorders which may occur in between 1 in 100 and 1 in 10,000 patients dependent on the GLP-1RA.

The risk of hypoglycaemia in non-diabetic patients is included in the product information for Saxenda and Wegovy which are licensed for weight management; patients should be made aware of the signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia and what action to take.

The MHRA has received Yellow Card reports for individuals who have been hospitalised due to suspected adverse drug reactions with GLP-1RAs when used for weight loss. Severe dehydration following gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions has been reported, including for individuals who may not meet the prescribing criteria and may have used these medicines inappropriately for weight loss. It is, however, difficult to confirm the inappropriate use or misuse of medicines from the Yellow Card data.

As of 28 October 2024, the MHRA has received 7228 reports of the common gastrointestinal reactions of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in association with GLP-1RAs indicated for weight management. Of these reports, 68 reported hospitalisation of the individual.

Please note that reports have been included whereby a brand of GLP-1RA which is used for weight management has been reported, but no indication provided. Reports have also been received by the MHRA that do not specify a brand name, provide details about indication of use or state the GLP-1RA was used for an indication other than weight management and subsequently have not been included in this data[\[footnote 2\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/glp-1-receptor-agonists-reminder-of-the-potential-side-effects-and-to-be-aware-of-the-potential-for-misuse#fn:2).

When interpreting this information, it is important to understand that the exact number of individuals using these medicines is unknown. The lack of prescribing data makes it difficult to determine how common an adverse drug reaction is. Additionally, the number of reports can be influenced by actual usage of the medicine, availability of the medicine and length of time since it was licenced for use. Due to the limitations of spontaneous reporting, some reports may lack information on serious outcomes including hospitalisation, and reports that did not report an indication without a brand name have not been included in this data, potentially underestimating the risk. Please also note that some reports may have reported other serious adverse drug reactions which may have also been the primary cause of hospitalisation, unrelated to gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions. Reports have been received that contain more than one common gastrointestinal adverse drug reaction, for example, vomiting and nausea.

## Report any suspected adverse drug reactions

Healthcare professionals should continue to report suspected adverse drug reactions to the Yellow Card scheme. When reporting please provide as much information as possible, including information about medical history, any concomitant medication, onset, treatment dates, product brand name, details of your suspicion of inappropriate use or misuse and include all relevant patient details including weight or BMI, and if possible, where the product was obtained (i.e. NHS prescription, private prescription, including online prescriptions, or illegitimate supplier). Reporting suspected ADRs, even those known to occur, adds to knowledge about the frequency and severity of these reactions and can be used to identify patients who are most at risk. Your report helps the safer use of medicines.

Healthcare professionals, patients, and caregivers are asked to submit reports using the Yellow Card scheme electronically using:

- the [Yellow Card](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/) website
- the Yellow Card app; download from the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id990237487?pt=117756671&ct=EYC&mt=8) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.mhra.yellowcard&referrer=utm_source%3DEYC%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26anid%3Dadmob)

# Insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) equipment: guidance for users on reporting suspected adverse incidents and safety concerns to the MHRA’s Yellow Card scheme

We ask healthcare professionals to support new guidance for users of diabetes management equipment, their families, care givers and representatives.

From:[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency)Published24 October 2024

Therapeutic area:[Endocrinology, diabetology and metabolism](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=endocrinology-diabetology-metabolism)

It explains how to report safety concerns to the MHRA using the Yellow Card scheme and describes the information we need to support our device investigations.

## Advice for healthcare professionals:

- insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices are complex devices with the potential to result in serious harm in the event of error. To aid the MHRA in early identification of safety concerns associated with these devices, users of the equipment need to know how to report safety issues to the MHRA
- [we have published guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-safety-concerns-with-insulin-pumps-and-continuous-glucose-monitoring-equipment) to explain to users of all medical devices manufactured for diabetes management how to report safety concerns to the MHRA using the Yellow Card scheme
- this guidance is expected to improve the quality of information the MHRA receives and should the need arise, support a thorough investigation of the relevant equipment
- [highlight the guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-safety-concerns-with-insulin-pumps-and-continuous-glucose-monitoring-equipment) to patients using insulin pumps, insulin pens and CGM devices
- remind patients that if they suspect a problem with their device, they should be advised to use an alternative method to manage their diabetes
- we are also [providing a poster](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/670519c130536cb927482dda/POSTER_-_FINAL_COPY.pdf) with a direct link to the guidance (QR code) which can be printed to display in your clinic waiting room
- healthcare professionals should also speak to their local Medical Device Safety Officer (MDSO) on how you can support the reporting of adverse incidents with these medical devices
- report problems and adverse incidents associated with medical devices used in the management of diabetes on a [Yellow Card](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard)

## Advice for healthcare professionals to provide to patients:

- seek medical advice without delay if you have concerns that your health has been impacted by a potential safety issue relating to your device
- use an alternative device if you suspect your current device is not performing adequately in managing your diabetes. Ensure you have an alternative device available at all times
- it is important to read the guidance being given to you on how to report concerns with the equipment used to manage your diabetes
- it is important that you report safety concerns with your devices to the Yellow Card scheme. Yellow Card reports help the MHRA to identify safety issues and to consider actions to improve the safety and performance of devices used by people living with diabetes
- if you believe there is a safety problem with your equipment, submit a report via the Yellow Card scheme and use the guidance document to help you create a report

## Background

The MHRA has identified an opportunity to improve the number and quality of reports we receive from members of the public using insulin pumps and CGM equipment for management of their diabetes.

A lack of detail in reports received from device users has made it difficult to thoroughly investigate potential safety issues. Discussion with external stakeholders also highlighted significant under-reporting amongst users of these devices. Contributing factors to under-reporting were a lack of awareness that Yellow Card reporting can be used for medical device-related safety issues, and lack of clarity on why the issue would need to be reported twice (once to the manufacturer to request replacement units and again to the MHRA for signal detection activities).

To address the issues affecting incident reporting with these devices, we have published guidance aimed specifically at device users and their families, care givers and representatives on why reporting concerns to us is important, what information they should include, and step-by-step instructions on how to create a report.

The MHRA requests that healthcare professionals bring this guidance to the attention of patients using insulin pumps and CGM devices.

## Report concerns with medical devices on a Yellow Card

If a patient tells you of problems with their equipment, please advise them to submit a report to the MHRA via the Yellow Card scheme and share the guidance document to help them.

If the patient is unable to submit a report, healthcare professionals should report incidents involving medical devices:

- in England and Wales to the [Yellow Card scheme](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard) or via the Yellow Card app
- in Scotland to [Incident Reporting & Investigation Centre (IRIC)](https://www.nss.nhs.scot/health-facilities/incidents-and-alerts/report-an-incident/) and their local incident recording system
- in Northern Ireland to the [Northern Ireland Adverse Incident Centre](https://www.health-ni.gov.uk/topics/safety-and-quality-standards/northern-ireland-adverse-incident-centre-niaic) and their local incident recording system.

# Bromocriptine: monitor blood pressure when prescribing bromocriptine for prevention or inhibition of post-partum physiological lactation

A safety review has been conducted by the MHRA following a Yellow Card report concerning a patient who was taking bromocriptine. The review concluded that blood pressure monitoring of patients prescribed with this drug is essential especially during the first days of treatment.

From:[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency)Published24 October 2024

Therapeutic area:[Breastfeeding](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=breastfeeding), [Dispensing GP practices](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=dispensing-gp-practices), [Obstetrics, gynaecology and fertility](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=obstetrics-gynaecology-fertility) and [Pregnancy](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=pregnancy)

## Advice for healthcare professionals:

- bromocriptine should only be prescribed to suppress post-partum physiological lactation, where it is medically indicated such as intrapartum loss, neonatal death, or in some cases of HIV infection of the mother

- bromocriptine should not be used for routine lactation suppression, or for relieving symptoms of postpartum breast pain and engorgement, which can be adequately treated with non-pharmacological interventions (such as firm breast support, ice application) and simple analgesics

- use is contraindicated for patients with uncontrolled hypertension, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (including eclampsia, pre-eclampsia or pregnancy-induced hypertension), hypertension post-partum and in the puerperium, a history of coronary artery disease or other severe cardiovascular conditions

- particular caution is required in patients who are on concomitant therapy or recent treatment with drugs that can alter blood pressure

- when prescribing bromocriptine for any of its indications, carefully monitor for an increase in blood pressure, especially during the first days of therapy and with any subsequent dose increases

- if patients prescribed bromocriptine present with signs and symptoms of hypertension, treatment should be discontinued, and the patient evaluated promptly by healthcare professionals

- clinical guidance[\[footnote 1\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/bromocriptine-monitor-blood-pressure-when-prescribing-bromocriptine-for-prevention-or-inhibition-of-post-partum-physiological-lactation#fn:1) recommends cabergoline as the preferred drug for prevention or inhibition of post-partum physiological lactation, owing to the single dose regime and lower rates of rebound breast activity and adverse events. However, blood pressure monitoring is still necessary when taking cabergoline as both cabergoline and bromocriptine are dopamine agonists and should not be given to women with hypertension or pre-eclampsia

- healthcare professionals are encouraged to read the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for special warnings and contraindications for the use of bromocriptine and cabergoline

- report suspected adverse drug reactions to bromocriptine or cabergoline to the [Yellow Card scheme](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard)


## Advice for healthcare professionals to provide to patients:

- bromocriptine is used to prevent or stop milk production after childbirth in women who are not breastfeeding only if there are medical reasons for doing so, for example to avoid further distress in women who lose a baby during or just after birth, or in some cases of HIV infection of the mother

- inform your doctor if you had blood pressure problems before or during pregnancy or after giving birth, such as eclampsia, pre-eclampsia, pregnancy-induced high blood pressure or high blood pressure after giving birth

- your doctor will need to check your blood pressure regularly during the first few days of treatment with bromocriptine

- seek urgent medical attention if you experience symptoms of high blood pressure, for example chest pain or unusually severe or persistent headache, with or without vision problems while taking bromocriptine

- report suspected adverse drug reactions to the [Yellow Card scheme](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard)


## Background

The MHRA has received a Yellow Card report which highlighted the need for blood pressure monitoring during bromocriptine treatment, especially during the first days of therapy. It is imperative that signs and symptoms of hypertension are recognised in patients receiving bromocriptine. Treatment with bromocriptine should be discontinued in hypertensive patients or when signs and symptoms of hypertension are detected and the patient promptly evaluated with consideration given as to whether they should be referred for further investigation and management of high blood pressure or close monitoring.

Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist which inhibits the release of prolactin by the pituitary gland and induces a cyclic and physiologic oestrogen secretion. Bromocriptine is indicated for the prevention or suppression of post-partum physiological lactation only where medically indicated (such as in case of intrapartum loss, neonatal death or in some cases of HIV infection of the mother).

Bromocriptine is not recommended for the routine suppression of lactation or for the relief of symptoms of post-partum pain and engorgement which can be adequately treated with non-pharmacological interventions (such as firm breast support, ice application) and simple analgesics.

Other indications for bromocriptine include hyperprolactinaemia, menstrual cycle disorders and female infertility, premenstrual symptoms and benign breast disease, prolactinomas, acromegaly and Parkinson’s disease. Blood pressure monitoring is required when bromocriptine is used for any of its indications.

## Clinical Guidelines

The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists’ [Guidance on Late Intrauterine Fetal Death and Stillbirth,](https://www.rcog.org.uk/media/0fefdrk4/gtg_55.pdf)[\[footnote 1\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/bromocriptine-monitor-blood-pressure-when-prescribing-bromocriptine-for-prevention-or-inhibition-of-post-partum-physiological-lactation#fn:1) Section 7.3, refers to use of both bromocriptine and cabergoline for lactation suppression but recommends cabergoline, as the single dose regime is easier to use and has shown significantly lower rates of rebound breast activity and adverse events.

Blood pressure should be carefully monitored during treatment with either bromocriptine or cabergoline, and use of these medications is contraindicated in patients with existing high blood pressure.

The Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for both [bromocriptine](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/15494/smpc) and [cabergoline](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/1691/smpc) details the indications, contraindications as well as the precautionary warnings of blood pressure monitoring.

## Reporting Advice

Please report any suspected adverse drug reactions through the Yellow Card scheme.
Healthcare professionals, patients, and caregivers are asked to submit reports using the Yellow Card scheme electronically using:

- the [Yellow Card](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/) website
- the Yellow Card app; download from the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id990237487?pt=117756671&ct=EYC&mt=8) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.mhra.yellowcard&referrer=utm_source%3DEYC%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26anid%3Dadmob)
- some clinical IT systems for healthcare professionals (EMIS, SystmOne, Vision, MiDatabank, and Ulysses

When reporting suspected adverse drug reactions, please provide as much information as possible, including information about medical history, any concomitant medication, onset timing, and treatment dates.

# Valproate use in men: as a precaution, men and their partners should use effective contraception

A retrospective observational study has indicated a possible association between valproate use by men around the time of conception and an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in their children.


Inform male patients who may father children of this possible increased risk and the recommendation to use effective contraception during valproate treatment and for at least 3 months after stopping valproate.

## Post-publication note - June 2025

In June 2025, the safety and educational materials for valproate were updated in line with the regulatory position and to reflect feedback from stakeholders. Please find the latest materials in our [June 2025 Drug Safety Update](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/valproate-belvo-convulex-depakote-dyzantil-epilim-epilim-chrono-or-chronosphere-episenta-epival-and-syonellv-updated-safety-and-educational-materials-to-support-patient-discussion-on-reproductive-risks).

See a previous [Drug Safety Update](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/valproate-belvo-convulex-depakote-dyzantil-epilim-epilim-chrono-or-chronosphere-episenta-epival-and-syonellv-new-safety-and-educational-materials-to-support-regulatory-measures-in-men-and-women-under-55-years-of-age) for the introduction of the prescribing requirements in patients under 55 years of age (female and male) – the new advice provided here is in addition to these measures.

No one should stop taking valproate without talking to their healthcare professional.

## Information for healthcare professionals:

- findings from a retrospective observational study, combining analyses of electronic medical records in Norway, Denmark and Sweden, indicate a possible increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children born to men treated with valproate in the 3 months prior to conception, compared to those born to men treated with lamotrigine or levetiracetam
- in the study, the cumulative risk of neurodevelopmental disorders ranged from 4.0% to 5.6% in the valproate treated group versus 2.3% to 3.2% in the composite lamotrigine/levetiracetam monotherapy treated group (pooled adjusted hazard ratio 1.50, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.07)
- this potential risk is much lower than the up to 30-40% risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children born to mothers taking valproate during pregnancy, estimated from several studies
- the study did not include an untreated group and background risk in this patient population is therefore unknown
- an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children of fathers treated with valproate in the 3 months prior to conception is possible however the causal role of valproate is not confirmed. As such this advice is precautionary

## Advice for healthcare professionals:

- inform male patients (of any age) who may father children of the possible risk at initiation of valproate or at their next regular treatment review – this counselling should be given irrespective of the indication for valproate and also after intravenous use of valproate
- as a precaution, recommend that male patients use effective contraception (condoms, plus contraception used by the female sexual partner) throughout the valproate treatment period and for 3 months after stopping valproate, to allow for one completed sperm cycle not exposed to valproate
- at the next regular treatment review, discuss with men on oral valproate treatment whether they are planning a family in the next year and if they are, refer to a specialist to discuss alternative treatment options
- if a female patient reports they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy with a man on valproate (including those undergoing IVF), refer for prenatal counselling
- advise men not to donate sperm during valproate treatment and for 3 months after stopping valproate
- report any suspected adverse drug reactions associated with valproate on a [Yellow Card](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)

## Information for healthcare professionals to provide to patients:

- if you father a child while you are taking valproate or in the 3 months after stopping valproate, there is a potential small increased risk of the child being diagnosed with a mental or movement related developmental disorder (neurodevelopmental disorder)
- please see the [valproate patient guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/valproate-reproductive-risks#materials-and-resources) for advice and [visual risk communication diagram to be used by a healthcare professional when counselling on the risks](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66d998d4e87ad2f1218264d8/Visual_risk_communication_diagram_to_be_used_by_a_healthcare_professional_when_counselling_on_the_risks_PUBLISH.pdf)

## Advice for healthcare professionals to provide to patients:

- it is recommended that you and your female sexual partner should both use effective birth control (condoms and another form of female contraception) as a precaution while you are taking valproate and for at least 3 months after stopping valproate
- allow at least 3 months to pass after stopping valproate before trying to father a child
- you should not donate sperm whilst taking valproate and for 3 months after stopping
- do not stop taking valproate unless you are advised to do so by a healthcare professional
- report any suspected adverse drug reactions associated with valproate on a [Yellow Card](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)

## Review of data regarding potential risk to children with paternal use of valproate

Valproate (as sodium valproate, valproic acid or valproate semisodium) is authorised for the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder. It is also used outside of the licence (‘off label’) to treat other conditions.

During the [2018 European review](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/referral/valproate-article-31-referral-prac-assessment-report_en.pdf) into the risks of valproate in pregnancy, a number of concerns were considered about risks in all patient groups, including the potential risks to children born to fathers who take valproate. A retrospective observational study was requested by the European regulatory authority to examine any association between exposure to valproate in men and the risk of congenital abnormalities and developmental disorders, including autism, in their offspring.

The MHRA review of the findings of the study was considered by the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM). We have published a [Public Assessment Report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/valproate-paternal-exposure-to-valproate-and-risk-of-neurodevelopmental-disorders-and-congenital-malformations-in-offspring) of the review.

The updated product information can be found [online](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/518/smpc). The Patient Information Leaflet in the box and hard-copies of the updated safety and educational materials will be available in the coming months. The current patient card will be amended to include advice for male patients in addition to the measures relating to the Pregnancy Prevention Programme for women. The manufacturers of valproate will also send a letter to relevant healthcare professionals in October 2024.

This advice is in addition to the existing requirements for oral formulations of valproate for two specialists to independently consider and document that there is no other effective or tolerated treatment or the risks are not applicable at initiation of treatment in male patients under 55 years. It is however noted that reproductive potential in male patients continues beyond 55 years and men older than 55 years on valproate should be counselled on the risk as appropriate.

Given the typical-use failure rate of condoms, it is advised that women whose sexual partners are using valproate should use effective contraception during use of valproate and for 3 months after the male partner stops valproate. It should be noted that if there is no pregnancy risk or if the woman is already using highly effective contraception, then condom use is not required to prevent pregnancy.

The Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health have [published a statement](https://www.fsrh.org/Public/Public/Documents/FSRH-statement-paternal-exposure-to-valproate.aspx) which includes some advice on contraceptive usage.

The potential risk to the offspring of men taking valproate around conception apply to both those taking valproate orally and intravenously (IV), however discussions with men on treatment options apply only to those taking valproate orally. For those who receive IV valproate in an acute care setting, advise the use of contraception for 3 months after treatment.

## Information about the study findings

The study looked at medical records from national registries in Norway, Denmark and Sweden. There was no observed association between paternal valproate exposure and neurodevelopmental adverse outcomes in the individual country specific study results, but when the results from the three countries were pooled using meta-analysis a statistically significant association was observed.

Overall, an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children of fathers treated with valproate in the 3 months prior to conception is possible however the causal role of valproate is not confirmed. In addition, the study did not evaluate the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders to children born to men stopping valproate for more than 3 months prior to conception (allowing new spermatogenesis without valproate exposure).

The study was not large enough to determine the absolute risk of each of the specific neurodevelopmental disorder subtypes included in the study (autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, communication disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, movement disorders). Study limitations included potential confounding by indication.

The study used secondary data, therefore data on some known risk factors and causal factors for neurodevelopmental disorders were not available. There was also a difference in follow-up time between comparator groups which may impact the findings. The mean follow-up time of children in the valproate group ranged between 5.0 and 9.2 years compared to 4.8 and 6.6 years for children in the lamotrigine/levetiracetam group. Further studies and data are needed to better understand this risk.

## Proposed mechanism of action of paternal transmission

The [2018 European review](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/referral/valproate-article-31-referral-prac-assessment-report_en.pdf) considered the potential mechanisms for paternal transmission of adverse effects of valproate. These included the valproate level of the seminal fluid of patients treated with valproate, evidence for genetic changes in the sperm DNA and evidence for epigenetic changes. It is noted that the estimated level of valproate in maternal plasma following exposure via seminal fluid is 25,000 times less than concentrations that would be present in maternal plasma after a standard dose of valproate. Hence, transmission of harm to the offspring from exposure to valproate through the seminal fluid is considered unlikely. Further studies are being performed to evaluate the possible impact of valproate on the genome and epigenome of germ cells.

There have been reports of infertility in men taking valproate but the mechanism of this is unclear. Preclinical data shows testicular toxicity in both juvenile and adult animals. Some preclinical data has also shown behavioural abnormalities transferred via the maternal and paternal lines through to the third generation. A CHM epigenetics Expert Working Group is currently considering evolving data on the potential for valproate to be associated with epigenetic effects, including the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitory properties of valproate.

## Report suspected reactions on a Yellow Card

Please continue to report suspected adverse drug reactions to the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/). Healthcare professionals, patients, and caregivers are asked to submit reports using the Yellow Card scheme electronically using:

## About the Biobank

The [Yellow Card Biobank](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/biobank) is a collaboration between the MHRA and Genomics England. The goal is to improve understanding of how a patient’s genetic makeup may increase their risk of experiencing harmful side effects to medicines.

Adverse drug reactions, or side effects, continue to be a significant burden on the NHS and account for one in 6 hospital admissions.[\[footnote 1\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/yellow-card-biobank-call-to-contribute-to-study-of-genetic-links-to-side-effects#fn:1) The Yellow Card Biobank forms part of a long-term vision for more personalised medicine approaches. By collecting biological samples from patients who have experienced suspected side effects, the Yellow Card Biobank aims to create a rich resource of genetic information that could help researchers to determine whether a suspected side effect was caused by a specific genetic trait. Ultimately it is hoped this would support the development of pharmacogenetic testing strategies.

If a patient under your care has experienced one of the side effects included in the pilot phase of the study, please [report without delay to the Yellow Card scheme,](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/) providing as much information as possible.

## Study details

Side effects covered in this pilot study are:

- severe bleeding events with a DOAC - apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban – see [Drug Safety Update](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/direct-acting-oral-anticoagulants-doacs-reminder-of-bleeding-risk-including-availability-of-reversal-agents) for a reminder on this risk
- rare severe skin reactions with [allopurinol,](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/13158/smpc) including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) syndrome

Once reported, the MHRA may contact you directly to discuss the case further and may ask you to contact the patient on our behalf to ask if they will participate in the Yellow Card Biobank study. The patient will be able to choose whether or not to take part. Having consented to participate the patient may then be asked to provide a blood sample for genetic analysis.

If you have already submitted a Yellow Card report in the past relating to either of the 2 study topics, we may also contact you directly in the coming months to discuss the case further.

Patients who report directly to Yellow Card will also be contacted to be included in the study.

## How the biobank works

The MHRA will be responsible for patient recruitment and sample collection. Genomics England will work alongside the MHRA to sequence and analyse genomes from patients and add this genomic data to the National Genomic Research Library, a secure national database of de-identified genomic and health data. In addition, Genomics England’s secure research environment will enable approved researchers to access the data.

All the information collected about you and patients through Yellow Card Biobank will be de-identified before researchers see it. Details of our privacy policy can be found in the [Biobank Privacy Policy.](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/biobank-privacy-policy)

If you have any questions about the biobank, you can email [Yellowcardbiobank@mhra.gov.uk](mailto:Yellowcardbiobank@mhra.gov.uk) or call 0203 080 6600 (lines are open Monday-Friday, 9am-12pm excluding bank holidays. Calls are charged at the standard rate). For general queries or more information, contact [info@mhra.gov.uk](mailto:info@mhra.gov.uk)

# Epimax Ointment and Epimax Paraffin-Free Ointment: reports of ocular surface toxicity and ocular chemical injury

Epimax Ointment and Epimax Paraffin-Free Ointment can harm the eyes if used on the face. Do not prescribe these ointments for use on the face. Tell patients to wash their hands and avoid touching their eyes after using these products.

From:[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency)Published23 July 2024

Therapeutic area:[Dermatology](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=dermatology), [Dispensing GP practices](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=dispensing-gp-practices) and [Ophthalmology](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=ophthalmology)

## Advice for healthcare professionals:

- do not prescribe or advise use of Epimax Ointment or Epimax Paraffin-Free Ointment on the face
- be aware that if Epimax Ointment or Epimax Paraffin-Free Ointment comes into contact with the eyes, patients may present with pain, swelling, redness or watering of eyes, sensitivity to light, blurred vision, burning or grittiness
- symptoms should resolve with discontinuation of the product around the eyes and can be treated with topical lubricants, topical antibiotics or topical steroids as required
- follow the advice in the manufacturer’s [Field Safety Notice](https://mhra-gov.filecamp.com/s/d/icXgbJO5IVPprV2f)
- healthcare professionals should report suspected adverse reactions associated with Epimax Ointment or Epimax Paraffin-Free Ointment via local and national reporting systems as described under the ‘report suspected reactions’ section further below in the article

## Advice for healthcare professionals to provide to patients:

- do not use Epimax Ointment or Epimax Paraffin-Free Ointment on your face as it has been reported to cause serious symptoms if it comes into contact with your eyes. It is only for use on the body
- wash your hands thoroughly after applying Epimax Ointment or Epimax Paraffin-Free Ointment and avoid touching your eyes after using these products
- if the product accidentally gets into your eyes, rinse well with water and seek medical advice

## Background

Epimax Ointment and Epimax Paraffin-Free Ointment are emollients, which are used to treat eczema, psoriasis and dry skin conditions. These specific products are regulated as medical devices, although some emollients are regulated as medicines.

The manufacturer, Aspire Pharma, previously issued a warning to users via a [Field Safety Notice](https://mhra-gov.filecamp.com/s/d/m5s053taVYNDbqou) on 20 January 2023, following a cluster of reports concerning ocular surface toxicity and ocular chemical injury in Scotland. These cases have subsequently been published.[\[footnote 1\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/epimax-ointment-and-epimax-paraffin-free-ointment-reports-of-ocular-surface-toxicity-and-ocular-chemical-injury#fn:1)

The case series reported novel ocular surface toxicity in 37 patients, related closely (often less than 1 week) to Epimax initiation. Most patients reported subjectively reduced visual acuity, frequently associated with photophobia. There was significant symptom resolution by first follow up appointment (average 7.3 days).[\[footnote 1\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/epimax-ointment-and-epimax-paraffin-free-ointment-reports-of-ocular-surface-toxicity-and-ocular-chemical-injury#fn:1)

In 2023 Aspire Pharma updated the product labelling to include advice on what to do if the product comes into contact with the eyes by accident, and to explain that it can be used as a body wash and not as a soap substitute that might be used on the face and around the eyes.

Following further similar reports across the UK, Aspire Pharma issued another [Field Safety Notice](https://mhra-gov.filecamp.com/s/d/icXgbJO5IVPprV2f) on 13 June 2024 to inform patients and healthcare professionals that product information would be updated to restrict use of the product to the body and to not use the product on the face, to wash hands after use and to further emphasise the warnings about avoiding contact with the eyes.

See page 3 of the [Field Safety Notice](https://mhra-gov.filecamp.com/s/d/icXgbJO5IVPprV2f) for the most up to date Epimax Ointment product labelling, and page 4 of the [Field Safety Notice](https://mhra-gov.filecamp.com/s/d/icXgbJO5IVPprV2f) for the most up to date Epimax Paraffin-Free Ointment product labelling.

## Report suspected reactions

Patients and caregivers should report suspected adverse reactions associated with all emollients, including Epimax Ointment or Epimax Paraffin-Free Ointment, to the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/).

As these specific ointments are classed as medical devices, there are specific reporting arrangements for healthcare professionals to follow in each region of the UK. An emollient which is regulated as a medical device will have a CE or UKCA mark. If it is regulated as a medicine, it will have a product licence (PL) number. See guidance for reporting on adverse reactions on the [Yellow Card website](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/information).

Healthcare professionals should report incidents involving medical devices:

- in England and Wales to the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/) or via the Yellow Card app
- in Scotland to [Incident Reporting & Investigation Centre (IRIC)](https://www.nss.nhs.scot/health-facilities/incidents-and-alerts/report-an-incident/) and their local incident recording system
- in Northern Ireland to the [Northern Ireland Adverse Incident Centre](https://www.health-ni.gov.uk/topics/safety-and-quality-standards/northern-ireland-adverse-incident-centre-niaic) and their local incident recording system.

When reporting, please provide as much information as possible, including information about batch numbers, medical history, onset timing, treatment dates, and product brand name.

# Topiramate (Topamax): introduction of new safety measures, including a Pregnancy Prevention Programme

Topiramate is now contraindicated in pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential unless the conditions of a Pregnancy Prevention Programme are fulfilled. This follows a review by the MHRA which concluded that the use of topiramate during pregnancy is associated with significant harm to the unborn child. Harms included a higher risk of congenital malformation, low birth weight and a potential increased risk of intellectual disability, autistic spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children of mothers taking topiramate during pregnancy.

From:[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency)Published20 June 2024

Therapeutic area:[Neurology](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=neurology), [Paediatrics and neonatology](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=paediatrics-neonatology) and [Pregnancy](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=pregnancy)

## General advice for healthcare professionals:

- topiramate should not be used:
  - in pregnancy for prophylaxis of migraine
  - in pregnancy for epilepsy unless there is no other suitable treatment
- topiramate should not be used in women of childbearing potential unless the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme are fulfilled. This aims to ensure that all women of childbearing potential:
  - are using highly effective contraception
  - have a pregnancy test to exclude pregnancy before starting topiramate
  - are aware of the risks from use of topiramate
- please see specific [advice for prescribers](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/topiramate-topamax-introduction-of-new-safety-measures-including-a-pregnancy-prevention-programme#prescribers) and [advice for dispensers](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/topiramate-topamax-introduction-of-new-safety-measures-including-a-pregnancy-prevention-programme#dispensers)
- ensure women of childbearing potential sign the Risk Awareness Form, you will receive materials including the Risk Awareness Form by post in the coming weeks to use in the implementation of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme
- report suspected adverse drug reactions associated with topiramate to the [Yellow Card](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard) scheme

## Advice for healthcare professionals to provide to patients:

- new measures are being introduced because there is evidence that taking topiramate during pregnancy can increase the risk to the baby of congenital malformation, low birth weight, intellectual disability, autistic spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
- use effective birth control (contraception) at all times during your treatment with topiramate and for at least 4 weeks after the last dose
- topiramate may interact with some hormonal contraceptives. Your General Practitioner (GP), specialist, sexual health and contraception clinic or contraception service in community pharmacy will discuss which method of birth control is best for you
- if you are thinking about having a baby, make an appointment with your GP. Do not stop using topiramate and contraception before you have talked to your doctor
- if you think you are pregnant and are taking topiramate for epilepsy, do not stop using topiramate. This may cause your seizures to start again or happen more often and last longer. Make an urgent appointment with your GP or epilepsy team (within a few days)
- if you think you are pregnant and are taking topiramate for migraine prevention, stop taking topiramate straight away and contact your GP
- it is important to visit your doctor to review your treatment at least once each year
- always read the safety leaflet that comes with your medicine and consult the new Patient Guide for information about the risk of topiramate use during pregnancy

## Review of harms of topiramate use during pregnancy

Topiramate is indicated for the prophylaxis of migraine and for the treatment of epilepsy. It is available as tablets, a liquid oral solution and as capsules that can be swallowed whole or sprinkled on soft food. The brand name of topiramate is Topamax, and so this may also appear on the box. Topiramate has been contraindicated in pregnancy for the prophylaxis of migraine since 2010.

Following a comprehensive review of the safety of antiseizure medications in pregnancy, including topiramate, new safety advice was [published](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/antiepileptic-drugs-in-pregnancy-updated-advice-following-comprehensive-safety-review) in January 2021. Since then, new study data has become available reporting a potential increased risk of autism spectrum disorder and effects on learning development in children exposed to topiramate during pregnancy[\[footnote 1\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/topiramate-topamax-introduction-of-new-safety-measures-including-a-pregnancy-prevention-programme#fn:1). These new data, and data suggesting increasing use of topiramate in women of childbearing age, triggered a [new safety review](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/topiramate-topamax-start-of-safety-review-triggered-by-a-study-reporting-an-increased-risk-of-neurodevelopmental-disabilities-in-children-with-prenatal-exposure). This review examined the available data on the risk of congenital malformations, effects on growth and development of the baby, and the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders when topiramate is used during pregnancy.

The review concluded that the use of topiramate during pregnancy is associated with significant harm to the unborn child (both from the confirmed risks of congenital malformations and low birth weight and the potential risk of neurodevelopmental disorders). The accumulating data suggest that:

- topiramate is amongst the antiseizure medications associated with a higher risk of congenital malformations (approximately 4 to 9 per 100 babies compared to around 1 to 3 babies in every 100 in the general population)[\[footnote 2\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/topiramate-topamax-introduction-of-new-safety-measures-including-a-pregnancy-prevention-programme#fn:2)
- the risk of congenital malformations with topiramate appears to be dose-dependent, however, a threshold dose below which no risk exists cannot be established
- topiramate is associated with a high prevalence of babies being born small for gestational age and weighing less at birth (approximately 18 per 100 babies affected); this is higher than the risk in babies born to women with epilepsy not taking antiseizure medication (approximately 5 in 100 babies affected) and may be higher than the risk with some other antiseizure medications[\[footnote 3\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/topiramate-topamax-introduction-of-new-safety-measures-including-a-pregnancy-prevention-programme#fn:3)
- topiramate may be associated with an approximately 2 to 3 times increased risk of intellectual disability, autistic spectrum disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder compared with children born to mothers with epilepsy not taking antiseizure medication.[\[footnote 1\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/topiramate-topamax-introduction-of-new-safety-measures-including-a-pregnancy-prevention-programme#fn:1)[\[footnote 4\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/topiramate-topamax-introduction-of-new-safety-measures-including-a-pregnancy-prevention-programme#fn:4)[\[footnote 5\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/topiramate-topamax-introduction-of-new-safety-measures-including-a-pregnancy-prevention-programme#fn:5)[\[footnote 6\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/topiramate-topamax-introduction-of-new-safety-measures-including-a-pregnancy-prevention-programme#fn:6)[\[footnote 7\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/topiramate-topamax-introduction-of-new-safety-measures-including-a-pregnancy-prevention-programme#fn:7)[\[footnote 8\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/topiramate-topamax-introduction-of-new-safety-measures-including-a-pregnancy-prevention-programme#fn:8)

Full information on the studies considered and their findings, can be found in the [Public Assessment Report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/topiramate-review-of-safety-in-pregnancy). This report also includes a plain language summary of the review and findings.

## New safety measures

Due to the accumulating data on these harms, further restrictions are being introduced with regards to the use of topiramate in women of childbearing potential and in pregnancy.

The use of topiramate is now contraindicated:

- in women of childbearing potential unless the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme are fulfilled (for all indications)
- in pregnancy for prophylaxis of migraine
- in pregnancy for epilepsy unless there is no other suitable treatment

## Materials to support the Pregnancy Prevention Programme:

Healthcare professionals will receive materials by post in the coming weeks to support discussions with patients and implementation of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme. These materials are also available online and consist of :

Patient Guide for [Migraine](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/rmm/3082/Document) and [Epilepsy](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/rmm/3081/Document) \- to be provided to all girls and women of childbearing potential who are started on, or continue to use, topiramate-containing medicines

Guide for Healthcare Professionals for [Migraine](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/rmm/3079/Document) and [Epilepsy](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/rmm/3080/Document)

Risk Awareness Form for [Migraine](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/rmm/3084/Document) and [Epilepsy](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/rmm/3083/Document) \- for the healthcare professional and the patient (or responsible person) to sign at initiation of treatment with topiramate and at annual treatment reviews. The patient should receive a copy of this form, a copy should be filed in the patient’s medical notes, and, if necessary, a copy sent to the patient’s GP

[Patient Card](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/rmm/3078/Document) \- to be given by pharmacists to all female patients who are dispensed topiramate to inform them of the risks

## Advice for prescribers:

- all women of childbearing potential being treated with topiramate- containing medicines must follow the requirements of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme. These conditions are also applicable to female patients who are not sexually active unless the prescriber considers that there are compelling reasons to indicate that there is no risk of pregnancy
- for all new women of childbearing, potential prescribers must:
1. assess their potential for pregnancy and discuss the need for them to be on the Pregnancy Prevention Programme
2. ensure that pregnancy has been excluded, by means of a negative pregnancy test, prior to starting treatment with topiramate
3. inform them of the potential risks of topiramate use in pregnancy and counsel them on treatment options
4. discuss with them the need to use highly effective contraception throughout treatment and for at least four weeks after the last dose of topiramate. See [guidance from Faculty of Family Planning and Sexual Health](https://www.fsrh.org/standards-and-guidance/documents/ceu-clinical-guidance-drug-interactions-with-hormonal/) on potential drug interactions with hormonal contraceptives and what this means for topiramate
5. complete the Risk Awareness Form with the patient (or responsible person)
6. provide a copy of the Patient Guide to the patient (or responsible person)
- for existing patients, prescribers must:
1. identify all women and girls of childbearing potential on topiramate and invite them in for review
2. complete the Risk Awareness Form with the patient (or responsible person) and at each annual review
3. provide a copy of the Patient Guide to the patient (or responsible person)

## Advice for dispensers:

- a visual warning symbol will be added to the pack of topiramate. This symbol will show a pregnant woman in a red circle with a line through it, with warning text about the risks and information about the new measures
- until warning symbols are present on packs, [stickers](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/rmm/3085/Document) will be available to print locally on eMC
- pharmacists should dispense in whole packs whenever possible. This will ensure that patients always see the warning symbol and receive the statutory information
- pharmacists should give the patient card to female patients when dispensing topiramate
- ask women or girls of childbearing potential if they are taking highly effective contraception, if they are not, pharmacists should advise them to contact their GP for a follow-up appointment

## Report suspected reactions on a Yellow Card

Please continue to report suspected adverse drug reactions to the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/). Healthcare professionals, patients, and caregivers are asked to submit reports using the Yellow Card scheme electronically using:

- the [Yellow Card website](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)
- the Yellow Card app; download from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yellow-card-mhra/id990237487) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.mhra.yellowcard&referrer=utm_source%3DEYC%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26anid%3Dadmob)
- some clinical IT systems for healthcare professionals (EMIS, SystmOne, Vision, MiDatabank, and Ulysses)

When reporting please provide as much information as possible, including information about batch numbers, medical history, any concomitant medication, onset timing, treatment dates, and product brand name.

# Warfarin: be alert to the risk of drug interactions with tramadol

Taking warfarin and tramadol together can cause harmful drug interactions, which can raise the International Normalised Ratio (INR), and result in severe bruising and bleeding, which in some patients could be fatal.

From:[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency)Published20 June 2024

Therapeutic area:[Dispensing GP practices](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=dispensing-gp-practices), [Haematology and oncology](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=haematology) and [Pain management and palliation](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=pain-management-palliation)

## Advice for healthcare professionals:

- warfarin is a coumarin-derived vitamin K antagonist which has a low therapeutic index, so continue to exercise caution when co-prescribing warfarin with other drugs, to minimise the risk of drug interactions
- ask patients about all the medicines that they are currently taking
- be aware of the risk of increased INR when warfarin and tramadol are used together, with a risk of major bruising and bleeding which could be life-threatening
- consult the product information of any new concomitant therapy for specific guidance on use with warfarin and consider whether warfarin dose adjustment is required
- consider whether additional monitoring of INR is required when starting tramadol or another concomitant medicine
- ensure patients are aware of the need to seek medical treatment should they notice the signs of a major bleeding event
- caution should also be taken if tramadol is co-prescribed with other coumarin-derived anticoagulants such as acenocoumarol
- report suspected adverse drug reactions to the [Yellow Card scheme](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard)

## Advice for healthcare professionals to provide to patients:

- warfarin can interact with some medicines, such as tramadol, leading to an increased risk of bleeding
- you should seek medical treatment and have an urgent International Normalised Ratio test should you experience any of the following symptoms:
  - prolonged nose bleeds (more than 10 minutes)
  - blood in vomit, sputum (phlegm), stool (poo) or urine (pee)
  - severe or unexplained bruising
  - severe bleeding gums
  - unusual headaches (headaches with blurred vision, slurred speech, loss of movement, feeling or being sick, fits, loss of consciousness, dizziness)
  - women who experience heavy or increased bleeding during their menstrual period or any other heavy vaginal bleeding
- inform your healthcare professional that you are taking warfarin and carry your anticoagulant alert card with you at all times
- inform your healthcare professional of all the medicines you are currently taking
- do not take any new medicines without first discussing this with your healthcare professional
- do not stop taking warfarin without first discussing this with your healthcare professional
- report suspected adverse drug reactions to the [Yellow Card scheme](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard)

## Risk of adverse drug interaction with tramadol

The MHRA has received a Coroner’s report following the death of a patient who died from a bleed on the brain, following concurrent treatment with warfarin and tramadol. Taking warfarin and tramadol together may increase a patient’s INR and increase the risk of bleeding. The Coroner raised concerns that the interaction between warfarin and tramadol was not well known and emphasised the need to highlight this interaction to healthcare professionals.

Warfarin is a coumarin-derived vitamin K antagonist used for prevention and treatment of blood clots. It is used to prevent embolisation in rheumatic heart disease and, atrial fibrillation and after insertion of prosthetic heart valves. Warfarin is also used in the prevention and treatment of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treatment of transient ischaemic attacks.

Warfarin has a low therapeutic index, which means care is required when taking co-prescribed medicines due to the possibility of interactions that could lead to an increased risk of bleeding.

The product information for warfarin advises that healthcare professionals should refer to the product information of any new concomitant medicines for specific guidance on use with warfarin and whether a dose adjustment or therapeutic monitoring is required. The product information will be updated to include the interaction in due course.

Tramadol is a non-selective opioid analgesic, which acts as an agonist at the mu, delta and kappa opioid receptors. Section 4.5 of the tramadol Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) states that caution should be exercised during concomitant treatment with coumarin derivatives such as warfarin due to reports of increased INR with major bleeding and bruising in some patients. While the risk of major bleeding with warfarin treatment is rare, the risk may be increased with concurrent use of tramadol.

## Report any suspected adverse drug reactions

Please continue to report suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to the Yellow Card scheme. Reporting suspected ADRs, even those known to occur, adds to knowledge about the frequency and severity of these reactions and can be used to identify patients who are most at risk. Your report helps the safer use of medicines.

Healthcare professionals, patients, and caregivers are asked to submit reports using the Yellow Card scheme electronically using:

- the [Yellow Card scheme website](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)
- the Yellow Card app; download from the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id990237487?pt=117756671&ct=EYC&mt=8) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.mhra.yellowcard&referrer=utm_source%3DEYC%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26anid%3Dadmob)
- some clinical IT systems for healthcare professionals (EMIS, SystmOne, Vision, MiDatabank, and Ulysses)

When reporting please provide as much information as possible, including information about medical history, any concomitant medication, onset, treatment dates, and product brand name.

# Topical steroids: introduction of new labelling and a reminder of the possibility of severe side effects, including Topical Steroid Withdrawal Reactions

Topical steroid products are safe and highly effective treatments for the management of a wide range of inflammatory skin diseases but have important risks, especially with prolonged use at high potency. In the coming months, as a result of regulatory action, topical steroid products will be labelled with information on their potency to simplify advice for patients.

From:[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency)Published29 May 2024

Therapeutic area:[Dermatology](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=dermatology)

## Advice for healthcare professionals:

- adverse reactions have been reported following long-term (generally 6 months or more) use of moderate or stronger potency topical steroids, particularly when used for eczema treatment – these reactions are often referred to as ‘Topical Steroid Withdrawal Reactions’ (TSW)
- symptoms of TSW can include intense redness, stinging, and burning of the skin that can spread beyond the initial treatment area
- the risk of these and other serious reactions increases with prolonged use of higher potency steroid products
- over the coming year, topical steroids will be labelled with information on their potency to assist with counselling patients
- when prescribing or dispensing topical steroids, advise on the amount of product to apply, how often, where to apply it and when to stop treatment
- if previous discontinuation was associated with reactions that raise suspicion of TSW, alternative treatments should be considered
- provide support to patients living with symptoms of TSW and review treatment plans with patients
- report suspected adverse drug reactions to the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/), including after discontinuation of topical steroids

## Advice for healthcare professionals to provide to patients and carers:

- cases of skin reactions have been reported by long-term users of topical steroids when stopping treatment, including intense redness, stinging, and burning of the skin that can spread beyond the initial treatment area (see [Patient Safety Leaflet on topical corticosteroids and withdrawal reactions](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/topical-corticosteroids-and-withdrawal-reactions))
- the exact frequency cannot be determined but the reactions are estimated to be rare
- if using more than one topical steroid on different body areas, ensure you are using the correct strength for the area of the body concerned. In the future the strength will be displayed on the packaging of your medicine
- seek medical advice before using a topical steroid on a new body area as some areas may require a different topical steroid
- always apply topical steroids as instructed and read the Patient Information Leaflet provided with your medicine
- ask your prescriber or pharmacist if you have any questions about your medicines or are concerned about side effects – and report suspected side effects to the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)

## Background

Topical steroids are highly effective for the treatment of inflammatory skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis, when prescribed and used appropriately. They are available in different potencies:

- mildly potent (for example, hydrocortisone)
- moderately potent (for example, clobetasone)
- potent (for example, betamethasone)
- very potent (for example, clobetasol)
The lowest potency topical steroid for effective treatment should be used and this may mean using different potency products for different body areas.

Over the coming year, topical steroids will be labelled with their potencies to aid correct selection and to simplify the advice to patients requiring multiple steroid products of differing potencies. These will be labelled ‘mild steroid’, ‘moderate steroid’, ‘strong steroid’, and ‘very strong steroid’.

## Serious side effects of topical steroid products

Whilst considered safe and effective, topical steroids can rarely lead to serious side effects such as thinning of the skin, adrenal suppression or very rarely Cushing’s syndrome, due to systemic absorption. The incidence of these more serious side effects is linked to the amount, potency and duration of use of the topical steroid.

Thinned skin appears translucent with visible tiny blood vessels and may be more fragile and more susceptible to stretch marks. This can be very difficult to see in brown or black skin, therefore careful monitoring is required.
Adrenal suppression arises from overuse of topical steroids. The symptoms include low blood pressure, dizziness and fainting. This is a serious, life-threatening condition that needs urgent treatment. Stopping the topical steroid suddenly is dangerous if there is adrenal suppression, and it is likely that the individual will require oral steroid therapy replacement.

Cushing’s syndrome manifests with the development of a red, puffy, rounded face, acne and excessive facial and body hair, high blood pressure, weight gain, stretch marks, slow wound healing and frequent infections.

Patients, particularly those who require prolonged use or are using very potent topical steroids, should be advised to look for these effects and seek prompt medical attention if they occur. Please review adrenal crisis [guidance](https://www.endocrinology.org/clinical-practice/clinical-guidance/adrenal-crisis/) and [information](https://www.endocrinology.org/media/4091/spssfe_supporting_sec_-final_10032021-1.pdf) from the Society of Endocrinology and [National Patient Safety alert](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/national-patient-safety-alert-steroid-emergency-card-to-support-early-recognition-and-treatment-of-adrenal-crisis-in-adults/) from NHS England for further advice.

In psoriasis, use of large quantities of topical steroids is associated with a risk of more severe disease such as generalised pustular psoriasis.

Patients have also reported experiencing a less well understood group of side effects that has been termed Topical Steroid Withdrawal (TSW) reactions. TSW is the generally accepted patient-led term for these reactions - this group of conditions do not necessarily meet the medical pharmacological definition of withdrawal. Whilst these are still poorly understood groups of reactions, the evidence to date is that these reactions typically occur in four stages:[\[footnote 1\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/topical-steroids-introduction-of-new-labelling-and-a-reminder-of-the-possibility-of-severe-side-effects-including-topical-steroid-withdrawal-reactions#fn:1),[\[footnote 2\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/topical-steroids-introduction-of-new-labelling-and-a-reminder-of-the-possibility-of-severe-side-effects-including-topical-steroid-withdrawal-reactions#fn:2)

1. A few days (usually) after discontinuation, there is an acute eruption of burning red, exudative skin which may extend to untreated areas
2. Skin becomes dry and itchy with shedding (desquamation)
3. Skin starts to recover but is more sensitive and intermittent flares may occur
4. Skin recovers to the state prior to topical corticosteroid cessation. The recovery process may be prolonged

Continued use of topical steroids should be re-evaluated and alternative treatment options explored if a suspected TSW has occurred. Further information on TSW can be found in the September 2021 [Drug Safety Update](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/topical-corticosteroids-information-on-the-risk-of-topical-steroid-withdrawal-reactions).

## Review of Topical Steroid Withdrawal

Since our last review of this issue in 2021 we have continued to receive reports and concerns from patients regarding TSW. The MHRA has carefully reviewed information received since the last review of this risk, and sought advice from the Commission on Human Medicines, with clinical experts in dermatology and representatives from dermatology charities being included in these discussions.

During our review, data gathered from Yellow Card reports and the scientific literature was considered. There was little new information identified in the literature and limited information to help characterise or identify the causes of these reactions. As there is still no accepted clinical definition for these reactions, not all cases of adverse reactions reported via Yellow Cards as TSW will be true withdrawal reactions. Some of the reported cases may be due to the worsening of the underlying condition or other unidentified causes. However, undoubtedly the review did identify cases of adverse reactions, often severe, which were associated with the prolonged use of moderate or high potency steroids.

Yellow Card reports up to August 2023 were reviewed and 267 reports were identified reporting reactions under the term TSW or with features that are often considered to be associated with this term. The majority of these reports contain information indicating that the patient experienced a severe reaction following long-term use of moderate to very potent steroids to control eczema.

The most commonly reported reactions include intense itching and burning, cycles of flaking skin, skin exfoliation and skin oozing. The reports also highlighted that the side effects experienced can be severe and patients require support as they can have a high psychological burden [\[footnote 3\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/topical-steroids-introduction-of-new-labelling-and-a-reminder-of-the-possibility-of-severe-side-effects-including-topical-steroid-withdrawal-reactions#fn:3) (see [Joint statement British Association of Dermatologists and National Eczema Society](https://www.bad.org.uk/topical-steroid-withdrawal-joint-statement/)). We have also received a small number of Yellow Card reports that indicate a similar reaction can start whilst topical steroids are still being used. However, overall, the reactions reported to us have been more severe when associated with stopping treatment.

Given the lack of new information in the scientific literature since the previous review, further research is required to fully understand the characteristics and reasons for these reactions.

There are over 11 million prescriptions issued for topical steroids each year.[\[footnote 4\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/topical-steroids-introduction-of-new-labelling-and-a-reminder-of-the-possibility-of-severe-side-effects-including-topical-steroid-withdrawal-reactions#fn:4) From the data available, TSW reactions are estimated to be rare; however, the reaction frequency cannot be confirmed due to uncertainties regarding under reporting of adverse reactions and the numbers of patient receiving repeat prescriptions. The number of reports of adverse reactions received must be put into context of the millions of people that have benefitted from topical steroid treatment without experiencing any problems.[\[footnote 5\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/topical-steroids-introduction-of-new-labelling-and-a-reminder-of-the-possibility-of-severe-side-effects-including-topical-steroid-withdrawal-reactions#fn:5)

We have updated our [Patient Safety Leaflet](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/topical-corticosteroids-and-withdrawal-reactions) for clinicians to use when discussing the risks and advice with patients.

## Report suspected reactions on a Yellow Card

Please continue to report suspected adverse drug reactions to the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/).

Healthcare professionals, patients, and caregivers are asked to submit reports using the Yellow Card scheme electronically using:

- the [Yellow Card website](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)
- the Yellow Card app; download from the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id990237487?pt=117756671&ct=EYC&mt=8) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.mhra.yellowcard&referrer=utm_source%3DEYC%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26anid%3Dadmob)
- some clinical IT systems for healthcare professionals (EMIS, SystmOne, Vision, MiDatabank, and Ulysses)

When reporting please provide as much information as possible, including information about batch numbers, medical history, any concomitant medication, onset timing, treatment dates, and product brand name.

# Letters and medicine recalls sent to healthcare professionals in April 2024

A summary of recent letters and notifications sent to healthcare professionals about medicines and medical devices, and information about the publication of two recent Device Safety Information pages. The article also includes information on a recent National Patient Safety Alert highlighting the need for reducing risks for transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO).

From:[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency)Published29 May 2024

Therapeutic area:[Cancer](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=cancer), [Endocrinology, diabetology and metabolism](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=endocrinology-diabetology-metabolism), [GI, hepatology and pancreatic disorders](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=gi-hepatology-pancreatic-disorders), [Haematology and oncology](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=haematology), [Immunosuppression and transplantation](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=immunosuppression-transplantation) and [Neurology](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=neurology)

## National Patient Safety Alert: Reducing risks for transfusion-associated circulatory overload (NatPSA/2024/004/MHRA)

On 4 April, we issued a [National Patient Safety Alert](https://www.gov.uk/drug-device-alerts/national-patient-safety-alert-reducing-risks-for-transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-natpsa-slash-2024-slash-004-slash-mhra) to highlight the need to reduce risks for transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO).

TACO is one of the most common causes of transfusion-related deaths in the UK and cases have increased substantially in recent years. Identifying risk factors for TACO prior to transfusion allows initiation of appropriate mitigating measures.

Issued 23 April 2024. The MHRA was alerted by Beyond Compliance and the UK National Joint Registry (NJR) to a significantly higher revision rate observed with the ORIGIN PS patient-matched total knee replacement. The ORIGIN PS variant, raised as a level 1 outlier, demonstrates a revision rate (per 100 patient years) that is at least two times higher than all other bicondylar knee replacements in the UK. This issue currently appears to be UK-specific as other international registries do not show the same increase in early revision surgeries.

As a precautionary measure, Symbios Orthopédie SA has initiated a voluntary suspension of all further sales and implantations, alongside a recall of all variants of the ORIGIN device family within the UK. This will be until such a time that further evidence is gathered and assessed.

# Finasteride: reminder of the risk psychiatric side effects and of sexual side effects (which may persist after discontinuation of treatment)

A patient alert card is being introduced for men taking finasteride to help raise awareness of the risk of psychiatric side effects and sexual dysfunction, including the potential for sexual dysfunction to persist after treatment has stopped. Healthcare professionals are reminded to monitor patients for both psychiatric and sexual side effects.

From:[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency)Published29 April 2024

Therapeutic area:[Dermatology](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=dermatology) and [Urology and nephrology](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=urology-nephrology)

## Advice for healthcare professionals:

- finasteride [has been associated](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/finasteride-rare-reports-of-depression-and-suicidal-thoughts) with depression, suicidal thoughts and sexual dysfunction
- patients have reported that sexual dysfunction (including decreased libido and erectile dysfunction) has persisted even after treatment was stopped
- before prescribing finasteride, ask patients if they have a history of depression or suicidal ideation
- advise patients to stop finasteride 1mg (Propecia) for male pattern hair loss immediately if they develop depression or suicidal thoughts and to contact their doctor as soon as possible
- advise patients prescribed finasteride 5mg (Proscar) for benign prostatic hyperplasia to consult their doctor for further medical advice as soon as possible if they develop depression or suicidal thoughts
- monitor patients for psychiatric and sexual side effects
- a patient card will be introduced in all finasteride packs, which will highlight the risk of sexual side effects and psychiatric side effects reported with finasteride to increase awareness among patients and prescribers
- report suspected adverse drug reactions associated with finasteride via the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)

## Advice for healthcare professionals to give to patients and caregivers:

- finasteride is a medicine that helps with the management of male pattern hair loss (androgenic alopecia; 1 milligram (mg) formulation) and benign (non-cancerous) enlargement of the prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia; 5mg formulation)
- finasteride has been associated with depressed mood, depression, suicidal thoughts and sexual dysfunction (including decreased sex drive and erectile dysfunction)
- in some cases sexual dysfunction has persisted in patients even after they have stopped taking finasteride
- before taking finasteride, inform your doctor if you have any personal history of depression or suicidal thoughts
- stop finasteride 1mg (Propecia) immediately if you develop depression or suicidal thoughts and contact your doctor as soon as possible
- if you are prescribed finasteride 5mg (Proscar) and you develop depression or suicidal thoughts, you should inform your doctor for further medical advice as soon as possible
- if you experience any problems with sexual function such as inability to get and maintain an erection or decrease in sex drive, please discuss this with your prescriber or doctor
- you may not notice some changes in your mood and behaviour so it is very important to tell your friends and family that you are taking this medicine and that it can have effects on psychological well-being. Others may notice changes and help you quickly identify any symptoms that you need to talk to your doctor about
- always read the leaflet that is provided alongside your medicine, which contains information about taking finasteride and a full list of known possible side effects.

## Review of persistent sexual dysfunction and psychiatric side effects with finasteride

Finasteride is a 5 alpha-reductase-type-2 inhibitor. The 1mg dose (Propecia) is indicated in men 18 to 41 years of age for the treatment of male pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia). The 5mg dose (Proscar) is indicated for the treatment and control of benign prostatic hyperplasia in adults.

The MHRA completed a safety review into finasteride following concerns from patients regarding a lack of awareness of these side effects amongst patients and healthcare professionals. We issued a previous [Drug Safety Update for finasteride](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/finasteride-rare-reports-of-depression-and-suicidal-thoughts) in 2017, however at the time the potential for persistence of some of the side effects were not widely known.

The MHRA recently reviewed the available evidence, including Yellow Card reports, published scientific literature and actions by other regulators, and this was considered by the Pharmacovigilance Expert Advisory Group (PEAG) of the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM). The PEAG noted that the product information for finasteride contains information regarding the potential for persistent sexual side effects after discontinuation with finasteride and depression and suicidal ideation. However, these side effects are not well known by prescribers and patients and therefore a Drug Safety Update article was recommended.

The PEAG also recommended inclusion of a patient card inside the pack. The card aims to increase awareness of the side effects including depression, suicidal thoughts and sexual dysfunction, and to advise patients on what to do if they experience these adverse effects. The patient card will be introduced this year.

A [Public Assessment Report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/finasteride-review-of-safety-data-and-expert-advice-on-management-of-risks) has been published on the risks associated with finasteride.

## UK reports of persistent sexual dysfunction after discontinuation of finasteride

Since the first report was received in November 1992, the MHRA has received 426 Yellow Card reports up until 5 April 2024 of finasteride (both 1mg and 5mg formulations) and sexual dysfunction, including reports of erectile dysfunction (inability to get and maintain an erection) and decreased sex drive. In almost half of these reports, the outcome was recorded as ‘not recovered’ or ‘not resolved’.

## UK reports of psychiatric dysfunction with finasteride

Since the first report was received in February 1993, the MHRA has received 281 reports of finasteride and depressed mood disorders and suicidal and self-injurious behaviours, up until 5 April 2024.

## Report suspected reactions on a Yellow Card

Please continue to report suspected adverse drug reactions to finasteride via the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/). Your report will help us safeguard public health. Healthcare professionals, patients, and caregivers are asked to submit reports using the Yellow Scheme electronically using:

- the [Yellow Card website](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)
- the Yellow Card app; download from the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id990237487?pt=117756671&ct=EYC&mt=8) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.mhra.yellowcard&referrer=utm_source%3DEYC%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26anid%3Dadmob)
- some clinical IT systems for healthcare professionals (EMIS, SystmOne, Vision, MiDatabank, and Ulysses)

When reporting, please provide as much information as possible, including information about medical history, any concomitant medication, onset timing, treatment dates and particularly if a side effect continued or started after treatment was stopped.

# Montelukast: reminder of the risk of neuropsychiatric reactions

Healthcare professionals prescribing montelukast should be alert to the risk of neuropsychiatric reactions in all patients including children and adolescents. Reported neuropsychiatric reactions include sleep disorders, hallucinations, anxiety and depression, as well as changes in behaviour and mood. Healthcare professionals should advise patients and their caregivers to be alert to these risks and seek medical advice as soon as possible if neuropsychiatric reactions occur.

From:[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency)Published29 April 2024

Therapeutic area:[Paediatrics and neonatology](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=paediatrics-neonatology) and [Respiratory disease and allergy](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=respiratory-disease-allergy)

## Advice for healthcare professionals:

- the warnings in the Patient Information Leaflet and Summary of Product Characteristics for all montelukast products in the UK have been strengthened and highlighted with a black box for greater emphasis
- be alert for neuropsychiatric reactions in patients taking montelukast; events have been reported in adults, adolescents, and children
- discontinue montelukast if patients experience new or worsening symptoms of neuropsychiatric reactions
- advise patients and their caregivers to carefully read the list of neuropsychiatric reactions in the Patient Information Leaflet and to seek medical advice immediately should they occur
- report all suspected adverse drug reactions associated with montelukast to the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)

## Advice for healthcare professionals to give to patients and caregivers:

- infrequently, some patients may experience new or worsening changes in mood, sleep or behaviour such as nightmares, aggression, anxiety or thoughts about self-injury while using montelukast
- you should seek immediate medical attention if you or your child experiences these symptoms; your prescriber is best placed to advise you on stopping this medicine if needed
- it is very important to tell your friends and family that you are taking montelukast and that this medicine is associated with infrequent neuropsychiatric side effects. This is because you may not notice some changes in your mood, sleep and behaviour. Other people may notice changes or new symptoms that you need to talk to your prescriber about
- the Patient Information Leaflet that comes with all montelukast products now includes warnings and advice about these psychiatric side effects in a black box
- it is important to read the Patient Information Leaflet that comes with your medicine or your child’s medicine
- talk to a healthcare professional if you or your child are experiencing any problems with the medicine
- patients, parents, and caregivers can report suspected adverse drug reactions to montelukast via the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)

## Review of neuropsychiatric reactions with montelukast

To increase awareness of the risks of neuropsychiatric effects with montelukast, new boxed warnings will be introduced to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) to make these risks more prominent to the reader. These warnings have been updated with the current evidence on the risk. Healthcare professionals and patients should familiarise themselves with this information.

It is well established that neuropsychiatric reactions may infrequently occur in association with montelukast. These are documented in the SmPC and PIL of all marketed montelukast products in the UK. A [Drug Safety Update was published in September 2019](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/montelukast-singulair-reminder-of-the-risk-of-neuropsychiatric-reactions) to remind healthcare professionals and patients of the risk of neuropsychiatric reactions with montelukast.

Since these actions were implemented, the MHRA has continued to receive Yellow Card reports and queries from patients and caregivers. The MHRA has therefore conducted a further review to evaluate the new evidence, taking into consideration the experiences of patients and caregivers and independent clinical advice from paediatricians, specialists in mental health and respiratory health, as well as experts in medicines safety at Expert Advisory Groups of the [Commission on Human Medicines](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/commission-on-human-medicines).

Review of the Yellow Card data has indicated a potential lack of awareness of the risk of neuropsychiatric reactions with montelukast amongst healthcare professionals, patients and their caregivers. Based on the overall evidence, the Pharmacovigilance Expert Advisory Group (PEAG) advised that montelukast should be immediately withdrawn due to the nature of the neuropsychiatric reactions, and that immediate withdrawal may help prevent escalation to more serious events. Therefore, updates to the product information have been implemented to ensure patients and healthcare professionals are aware of these risks and what action should be taken.

## UK reports of neuropsychiatric reactions with montelukast

A range of neuropsychiatric reactions have been reported in association with montelukast. Among these are:

- sleep disturbances, depression and agitation including aggressive behaviour (may affect up to 1 in 100 people taking montelukast)
- disturbances of attention or memory (up to 1 in 1,000 people)
- very rarely, hallucinations and suicidal thinking and behaviour (up to 1 in 10,000 people).

See the SmPC (section 4.8) and the PIL (section 4) for full details.

Since first authorised in the UK in 1998, there have been approximately 44 million prescriptions of montelukast issued. During this time, the MHRA has received 1,223 reports of suspected neuropsychiatric adverse reactions. Information on neuropsychiatric reactions with montelukast was first introduced in the SmPC in 2008 and a detailed warning was added in 2019.

Of these, the most frequently reported suspected neuropsychiatric reactions associated with montelukast for all age groups were sleep disorders, hallucinations, anxiety and depression, as well as changes in behaviour and mood. The most frequently reported reactions in younger children (up to and including 12 years old) were aggression, nightmares and anxiety while in older children (13 years old up to and including 17 years old) the most commonly reported were anxiety, suicidal ideation and depression.

## About montelukast

Montelukast sodium is an oral leukotriene receptor antagonist. It is indicated for patients 6 months and older:

- for the treatment of asthma as add-on therapy in those patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma who are inadequately controlled on inhaled corticosteroids and in whom “as-needed” short acting beta-agonists provide inadequate clinical control of asthma
- for the prophylaxis of asthma in which the predominant component is exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.

## Report any suspected adverse reactions on a Yellow Card

Please continue to report suspected adverse drug reactions to the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/). Healthcare professionals, patients, and caregivers are asked to submit reports using the Yellow Card scheme electronically using:

- the [Yellow Card website](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)
- the Yellow Card app; download from the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id990237487?pt=117756671&ct=EYC&mt=8) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.mhra.yellowcard&referrer=utm_source%3DEYC%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26anid%3Dadmob)
- some clinical IT systems for healthcare professionals (EMIS, SystmOne, Vision, MiDatabank, and Ulysses)

When reporting please provide as much information as possible, including information about batch numbers, medical history, any concomitant medication, onset timing, treatment dates, and product brand name.

## Medical Device Safety Information

We recently published Device Safety Information pages on the following topics:

[Counterfeits and unbranded copies of LifeVac anti-choking devices may fail to work correctly or worsen choking incidents if used, (DSI/2024/003).](https://www.gov.uk/drug-device-alerts/counterfeits-and-unbranded-copies-of-lifevac-anti-choking-devices-may-fail-to-work-correctly-or-worsen-choking-incidents-if-used-dsi-slash-2024-slash-003) Issued: 25 March 2024. Anti-choking devices are intended to alleviate choking incidents after Basic Life Support protocols have been attempted and failed. There are numerous counterfeit and unbranded anti-choking devices being sold in the UK online which do not have a valid UKCA or CE mark and may pose a significant risk of worsening choking if used. These devices should not be used in the event of a choking emergency and should be disposed of once identified as counterfeit or non-compliant. For additional information, please refer to the [Device Safety Information page.](https://www.gov.uk/drug-device-alerts/counterfeits-and-unbranded-copies-of-lifevac-anti-choking-devices-may-fail-to-work-correctly-or-worsen-choking-incidents-if-used-dsi-slash-2024-slash-003)

## Medicine Recalls and Notifications

In February 2024, recalls and notifications for medicines were issued on:

[Class 4 Medicines Defect Information: Exeltis UK Limited, Gepretix 100mg Capsules, EL (24)A/04.](https://www.gov.uk/drug-device-alerts/class-4-medicines-defect-information-exeltis-uk-limited-gepretix-100mg-capsules-el-24-a-slash-04) Issued: 1 February 2024. Exeltis UK Limited has informed the MHRA regarding an inconsistency in the Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) packaged in cartons of the specified batches of Gepretix 100mg capsules.

[Class 3 Medicines Recall: Torrent Pharma (UK) Limited, Ramipril 1.25mg tablets, EL(24)A/05.](https://www.gov.uk/drug-device-alerts/class-3-medicines-recall-torrent-pharma-uk-limited-ramipril-1-dot-25mg-tablets-el-24-a-slash-05) Issued: 13 February 2024. Torrent Pharma (UK) Limited is recalling batches of Ramipril 1.25mg tablets as a precautionary measure due to these batches having a low assay and high related substances test results after their release to the market.

[Class 2 Medicines Recall: Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Limited, Adakveo 10 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion, EL(24)A/06.](https://www.gov.uk/drug-device-alerts/class-2-medicines-recall-novartis-pharmaceuticals-uk-limited-adakveo-10-mg-slash-ml-concentrate-for-solution-for-infusion-el-24-a-slash-06) Issued: 21 February 2024. Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Limited is recalling Adakveo 10 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion, batch number SJFN5, due to the benefit-risk balance of Adakveo no longer being considered favourable by the MHRA. This is because the Phase III study (STAND) of Adakveo in sickle cell disease patients with vaso-occlusive crises did not confirm its clinical benefit. As a consequence, the conditional marketing authorisation in the UK is being revoked.

[Class 4 Medicines Defect Information: Orifarm UK Ltd, Concerta XL 18mg & 36 mg prolonged release tablets, EL (24)A/07.](https://www.gov.uk/drug-device-alerts/class-4-medicines-defect-information-orifarm-uk-ltd-concerta-xl-18mg-and-36-mg-prolonged-release-tablets-el-24-a-slash-07) Issued: 26 February 2024. Orifarm UK has informed the MHRA of an error with the Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) packaged within the parallel import packs of the above batches of Concerta XL 18mg and 36mg prolonged release tablets. A section of the product side effects containing the serious side effects has been added to paragraph 3 in error however this should be part of paragraph 4. All other sections of the PIL are unaffected.

## Medical Device Safety Information

We recently published Device Safety Information pages on the following topics:

[MAGEC X System, NuVasive Specialized Orthopedics (NSO): UK suspension lifted, (DSI/2024/002).](https://www.gov.uk/drug-device-alerts/magec-x-system-nuvasive-specialized-orthopedics-nso-uk-suspension-lifted-dsi-slash-2024-slash-002) Issued: 12 March 2024. The MHRA has conducted a thorough assessment of technical and biological safety information provided by NSO and is satisfied that the modified MAGEC X system can now be used in the UK. NSO has agreed to meet a set of conditions to monitor the long-term safety and performance of the device. All previous generations of the MAGEC system (MAGEC 1,1.5, 2B) remain suspended in the UK and should not be implanted. For additional information, please refer to the [Device Safety Information page.](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65f05bafff11700011615969/DSI_-_MAGEC-_2024.002_12.03.2024.pdf)

# Codeine linctus (codeine oral solutions): reclassification to prescription-only medicine

Advice for healthcare professionals on the reclassification of codeine linctus to a prescription-only medicine (POM), following a public consultation.

From:[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency)Published20 February 2024

Therapeutic area:[Dispensing GP practices](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=dispensing-gp-practices), [Pain management and palliation](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=pain-management-palliation), [Psychiatry](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=psychiatry) and [Respiratory disease and allergy](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=respiratory-disease-allergy)

## Advice for healthcare professionals:

- codeine linctus is to be reclassified from a pharmacy-only medicine (P) to a prescription-only medicine (POM) owing to the risk of dependence, addiction, and overdose
- codeine linctus is only authorised for the treatment of dry cough
- codeine linctus is only considered to be effective in the treatment of chronic cough lasting over 8 weeks[\[footnote 1\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/codeine-linctus-codeine-oral-solutions-reclassification-to-prescription-only-medicine#fn:1)
- advise patients that those with a long-term cough should see a healthcare professional, for review of symptoms and may require medical assessments to check for other conditions which may be the cause of the cough
- we would encourage healthcare professionals to read the Summary of Product Characteristics for special warnings and contraindications for the use of codeine linctus, especially in patients with a history of substance abuse
- record prescription details in the patient’s summary care record (or equivalent) and encourage patients to read the Patient Information Leaflet that comes with their medicine
- report suspected adverse drug reactions to codeine linctus to the [Yellow Card scheme](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard)

## Advice for healthcare professionals to provide to patients:

- codeine linctus (also known as codeine oral solution) is used in the treatment of dry cough, in adults and children aged 12 to 18 years without breathing difficulties
- codeine is an opioid medicine and is addictive. Codeine linctus will only be available on prescription following assessment with a healthcare professional. This action is being taken to reduce the risk of addiction or overdose
- evidence is limited that codeine linctus is effective in the treatment of short-term cough but may be effective in the treatment of long-term cough (lasting over 8 weeks)
- alternative non-prescription cough medicines are available for short-term cough to sooth an irritated throat, including honey and lemon mixtures and cough suppressants. You can speak to a pharmacist for advice
- if you have a long-term cough, you may be asked to attend further medical assessments to check for other conditions which could be causing the cough. This is to make sure you are on the best treatment
- addiction can happen gradually especially if you have been taking codeine for a long time. If you want to stop taking it and have been taking codeine linctus for a long time, then it is important to reduce the amount you take slowly with the help of your prescriber
- if you feel that you are addicted, speak to your doctor, or if you are concerned for someone who has been using more than the prescribed amount of codeine linctus, you can also [seek advice on the NHS website.](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/addiction-support/advice-for-the-families-of-drug-users/) Support groups and self-help groups are also available such as [Talk to FRANK](https://www.talktofrank.com/)
- patients are urged not to buy codeine linctus from [an unregistered website](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/15-years-of-op-pangea-over-25-million-illegally-traded-medicines-and-devices-seized-in-the-uk-valued-at-more-than-84m) as it could be dangerous

## Background

Codeine linctus (also known as codeine oral solution) is authorised for the treatment of dry coughs in adults and children aged 12 to 18 years without breathing difficulties. Codeine linctus is not authorised for the treatment of pain.

Codeine linctus has been used as a cough medicine for many years, although the evidence for effectiveness in short-term cough is limited.[\[footnote 1\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/codeine-linctus-codeine-oral-solutions-reclassification-to-prescription-only-medicine#fn:1)

Codeine is converted into morphine by the liver enzyme CYP2D6. Some people (known as ultra-rapid metabolisers) convert codeine into morphine faster than others. Evidence indicates that morphine is effective in the treatment of chronic cough. [\[footnote 2\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/codeine-linctus-codeine-oral-solutions-reclassification-to-prescription-only-medicine#fn:2) However, patients with chronic cough may have underlying conditions, and they should undergo medical investigation to establish the best treatment.

As an opioid medicine, codeine linctus is known to be addictive.

## Recent review of safety of codeine linctus

Recent safety information has revealed that codeine linctus is being used recreationally for its opioid effects, rather than for its intended use as a cough suppressant. This carries a serious risk of addiction and overdose which can be fatal.

Significant concerns have been raised concerning the use of codeine linctus as an ingredient in the recreational drink known as ‘Purple Drank’ (alternative names: ‘Lean’, ‘Sizzurp’, ‘Dirty Sprite’). As codeine linctus is used in varying amounts in this drink, consumers may not be aware of how much they are taking, and this can have serious risks such as loss of consciousness, respiratory suppression and death. Concomitant use with a central nervous system (CNS) depressant, such as alcohol, sedatives or other medicines, will further increase these risks. The MHRA has found evidence of Purple Drank being popularised through social media targeting young adults and has received an increased number of reports of the sale of codeine linctus through non-regulated and potentially illicit websites. Healthcare professionals have also identified individuals repeatedly requesting codeine linctus who are potentially addicted to it.

In October 2022, the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) advised that codeine linctus should be made available as a prescription-only medicine (POM). The MHRA [undertook a public consultation](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/mhra-public-consultation-on-the-proposal-to-make-codeine-linctus-available-as-a-prescription-only-medicine-pom) to obtain views on its reclassification. The consultation ran from 18 July 2023 to 15 August 2023.

Following the results of the public consultation and the further advice of the CHM, codeine linctus will no longer be supplied without a prescription. This is a risk minimisation measure to protect the health of patients in need of treatment, to prevent recreational use and to enable the identification of individuals who may have become unintentionally addicted to codeine.

Patients will still be able to access codeine linctus with a prescription from a qualified healthcare professional. This will ensure that the medicine is used safely and appropriately under medical supervision.

All market authorisation holders (MAH) are in the process of updating their product licences to reflect the change to POM. Once the licences have been updated the MAHs have committed to implement the changes to their product information within 3 months. The MHRA made a public announcement as soon as possible in the interests of public safety. To avoid any ‘stockpiling’, all existing codeine linctus stock should now be treated as POM.

## Monitoring of codeine linctus side effects

The MHRA has been monitoring the risk of addiction to codeine for a number of years and regulatory action has been taken to improve product information and labelling. However, codeine linctus usage may result in dependence or addiction and we have seen abuse of this medicine when used in recreational drinks such as Purple Drank. For those who are ultra-rapid metabolisers of codeine, the risk of opioid toxicity is increased.

Opioid toxicity may resemble overdose in presentation with symptoms such as respiratory depression, pinpoint pupils, coma and death.

The consumption of codeine in recreational drinks leads to an increased risk of sedation and may cause the user to lose track of how much they have consumed.

Between January 2017 and May 2022, the National Poison Information Service received 19 calls in relation to codeine linctus, including codeine paediatric linctus, ‘Purple Drank’, ‘Lean’, ‘Sizzurp’, ‘Dirty Sprite’ and pholcodine linctus.

Data from the Office for National Statistics revealed an increase in the annual number of deaths where codeine was involved from 88 deaths in 2011 to 200 deaths in 2021. This does not include deaths where codeine was used in a compound formulation, for example, where codeine has been combined with paracetamol, but may include deaths where patients were obtaining codeine by prescription as well as non-prescription methods. It is not possible to determine how many patients have overdosed or died because of the misuse of codeine linctus itself, as case reports may simply name codeine as the implicated drug and do not specify the brand name or pharmaceutical form.

The MHRA has received 3 case reports describing addiction specifically with codeine linctus. The public have also informed us of several suspected cases of addiction through our consultation. However significant under-reporting of addiction is likely as those using codeine recreationally may be less likely to submit reports.

## Report side effects, including dependence

Please continue to report any suspected adverse drug reactions through the Yellow Card scheme. If a patient experiences any side effect related to dependence to a medicine or is recognised by the prescriber to be dependent, the CHM encourages prescribers, patients, or carers to report this to the MHRA through the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/) with the term ‘dependence’. Your report will help us safeguard public health.

Healthcare professionals, patients, and caregivers are asked to submit reports using the Yellow Card scheme electronically using:

- the [Yellow Card website](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)
- the Yellow Card app; download from the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id990237487?pt=117756671&ct=EYC&mt=8) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.mhra.yellowcard&referrer=utm_source%3DEYC%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26anid%3Dadmob)
- some clinical IT systems for healthcare professionals (EMIS, SystmOne, Vision, MiDatabank, and Ulysses)

When reporting suspected adverse drug reactions, please provide as much information as possible, including information about medical history, any concomitant medication, onset timing, and treatment dates.

This article was updated on 22 February 2023 to provide clarity on the timing of the reclassification.

# Pseudoephedrine: very rare risk of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS)

There have been very rare reports of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) with pseudoephedrine.

From:[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency)Published20 February 2024

Therapeutic area:[Cardiovascular disease and lipidology](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=cardiovascular-disease-lipidology), [Dispensing GP practices](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=dispensing-gp-practices), [Ear, nose and throat](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=ear-nose-throat), [Haematology and oncology](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=haematology), [Infectious disease](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=infectious-disease), [Neurology](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=neurology) and [Respiratory disease and allergy](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=respiratory-disease-allergy)

Patients and caregivers should be advised to be alert to the symptoms for PRES and RCVS, to stop the medication immediately and to seek urgent medical attention if these occur. If someone presents with symptoms of PRES or RCVS, ask about their medication history.

## Advice for healthcare professionals:

- PRES and RCVS present with the following symptoms: sudden severe headache or thunderclap headache, sudden onset of nausea and vomiting, confusion, seizures and/or visual disturbances
- PRES and RCVS are recognised very rare side effects with pseudoephedrine-containing medicines, which are used for the symptomatic treatment of nasal and sinus congestion with colds, flu and allergies
- pseudoephedrine is for short term use only and should not be used for prolonged or extended use
- use of the product is contraindicated in patients with severe hypertension or uncontrolled hypertension, or severe renal disease
- report suspected adverse drug reactions associated with pseudoephedrine on a [Yellow Card](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)

## Advice for healthcare professionals to provide to patients:

- pseudoephedrine is used to relieve the symptoms of nasal and sinus congestion with colds, flu and allergies
- pseudoephedrine-containing medicines are for short-term, symptomatic use only; people should follow the instructions for use in the Patient Information Leaflet
- there has been a very small number of reports of PRES and RCVS with these medicines; PRES and RCVS are rare conditions that can involve inflammation and/or reduced blood supply to the brain
- if you experience a severe headache that develops very quickly or you suddenly feel sick or are vomiting, confused or experiencing seizures or changes in vison, then stop taking the medicine immediately and seek urgent medical attention
- do not take pseudoephedrine if you have very high blood pressure (hypertension) or hypertension not controlled by your medicines
- do not take pseudoephedrine if you have severe acute (sudden) or chronic (long-term) kidney disease or kidney failure. Speak to your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure
- people who take a medicine may experience a non-serious side effect, and these are typically mild, but it is important to read the [Patient Information Leaflet](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/files/pil.6198.pdf) that comes with your medicine and to talk to a healthcare professional if you are experiencing problems

## Review of PRES and RCVS with pseudoephedrine

Pseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic and is approved as a single active substance or in fixed dose combinations with analgesics, antihistamines, and cough medicines. Pseudoephedrine is used for the symptomatic relief of nasal and sinus congestion associated with the common cold and flu in adults and adolescents. It is also used for the treatment of the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients, including use in children aged 2 to 12 years of age who have nasal congestion.

There have been very rare reports of PRES and RCVS with pseudoephedrine. A review of the available evidence, including the assessment of cumulative reporting of adverse drug reaction reports, was considered by the Pharmacovigilance Expert Advisory Group (PEAG) of the [Commission on Human Medicines (CHM).](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/commission-on-human-medicines/about/membership) The PEAG recommended updates to the [Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC)](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/6198/smpc/print) and the [Patient Information Leaflet (PIL)](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/files/pil.6198.pdf) to further describe the risk of PRES and RCVS and the potential risk factors for these conditions, and advised the MHRA to remind healthcare professionals and patients of these risks.

## About PRES and RCVS

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), also known as reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), is a rare condition in which parts of the brain are affected by swelling, usually as a result of an underlying cause such as severely elevated blood pressure, kidney failure, severe infections, certain medications, some autoimmune diseases and pre-eclampsia. The diagnosis is usually made by imaging of the brain, which may enable areas of swelling to be identified. PRES usually has an acute onset characterised by headaches and seizures; many people also experience visual changes, confusion and drowsiness, weakness of the arm and/or leg on one side of the body (hemiplegia), difficulty speaking, or more rarely other neurological symptoms.

Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS), also known as Call-Fleming syndrome, is a rare condition characterised by thunderclap headaches which are sudden, intense headaches that can reoccur over a few days to weeks and are often associated with nausea and sensitivity to light. RCVS can also be associated with acute neurological symptoms such as seizure and stroke. Symptoms are thought to arise from transient constriction in the blood vessels of the brain. In some cases, RCVS may be associated with childbirth, vasoactive or illicit drug use, head trauma, autoimmune or blood disorders, or complications of pregnancy. RCVS is usually diagnosed by brain imaging with angiography, to identify constrictions in cerebral blood vessels.

For both conditions, patients typically fully recover within 3 months with early recognition and treatment.

# Valproate (Belvo, Convulex, Depakote, Dyzantil, Epilim, Epilim Chrono or Chronosphere, Episenta, Epival, and Syonell▼): new safety and educational materials to support regulatory measures in men and women under 55 years of age

New safety and educational materials have been introduced for men and women and healthcare professionals to reduce the harms from valproate, including the significant risk of serious harm to the baby if taken during pregnancy and the risk of impaired fertility in males.

From:[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency)Published22 January 2024

Therapeutic area:[Neurology](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=neurology), [Obstetrics, gynaecology and fertility](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=obstetrics-gynaecology-fertility) and [Psychiatry](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=psychiatry)

## Post-publication note - June 2025

In June 2025, the safety and educational materials for valproate were updated in line with the regulatory position and to reflect feedback from stakeholders. Please find the latest materials in our [June 2025 Drug Safety Update](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/valproate-belvo-convulex-depakote-dyzantil-epilim-epilim-chrono-or-chronosphere-episenta-epival-and-syonellv-updated-safety-and-educational-materials-to-support-patient-discussion-on-reproductive-risks).

These safety and educational materials support the new regulatory measures announced in the [National Patient Safety Alert.](https://www.gov.uk/drug-device-alerts/national-patient-safety-alert-valproate-organisations-to-prepare-for-new-regulatory-measures-for-oversight-of-prescribing-to-new-patients-and-existing-female-patients-natpsa-slash-2023-slash-013-slash-mhra)

Healthcare professionals should review the new measures and materials and integrate them into their clinical practice when referring patients and when prescribing or dispensing valproate.

We are also reviewing data highlighted in [Drug Safety Update August 2023](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/valproate-re-analysis-of-study-on-risks-in-children-of-men-taking-valproate#:~:text=Valproate%20administration%20may%20also%20impair,of%20male%20infertility%20was%20unknown.), which may suggest an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children whose fathers took valproate in the 3 months before conception. As a precaution we advise male patients who are planning a family within the next year, to discuss treatment options with a healthcare professional.

## Post-publication note - September 2024

Further advice has now been issued in [Drug Safety Update September 2024](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/valproate-use-in-men-as-a-precaution-men-and-their-partners-should-use-effective-contraception) for a potentially increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children fathered to men taking valproate around the time of conception.

## Advice for healthcare professionals:

- valproate must not be started in new patients (male or female) younger than 55 years, unless two specialists independently consider and document that there is no other effective or tolerated treatment, or there are compelling reasons that the reproductive risks do not apply. For the majority of patients, other effective treatment options are available
- at their next annual specialist review, women of childbearing potential and girls receiving valproate should be reviewed using the revised valproate Annual Risk Acknowledgement Form. A second specialist signature will be needed if the patient is to continue on valproate, however subsequent annual reviews will only require one specialist
- general practice and pharmacy teams should continue to prescribe and dispense valproate and if required offer patients a referral to a specialist to discuss their treatment options. Valproate should be [dispensed](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/full-pack-dispensing-of-valproate-containing-medicines/full-pack-dispensing-of-valproate-containing-medicines) in the manufacturer’s original full pack
- report suspected adverse drug reactions associated with valproate on a [Yellow Card](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard)

## Advice for healthcare professionals to provide to patients:

- do not stop taking valproate without advice from a specialist. This is because epilepsy or bipolar disorder may worsen without treatment
- if you are on valproate, please attend any offered appointments to discuss your treatment plan and talk to a healthcare professional if you are concerned
- consult the [Patient Information Leaflet](https://products.mhra.gov.uk/search/?search=valproate&page=1) and new [Patient Guide](https://mhra-gov.filecamp.com/s/i/Zw7qR7wEy1YKeIEf) for information about the risks of valproate – see also the [MHRA information page](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/valproate-safety-measures) for resources
- as a precaution, male patients who are planning a family within the next year should speak to a healthcare professional about their treatment options

## Valproate treatment and new safety measures

Exposure to valproate in pregnancy is associated with physical birth defects in 11% of babies and neurodevelopmental disorders in up to 30-40% of children, which may lead to permanent disability. Since 2018, valproate has been contraindicated in women of childbearing potential unless the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme (PPP) are followed.

In 2022, the [Commission on Human Medicines](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/commission-on-human-medicines) (CHM) reviewed the latest data on the safety of valproate. The CHM heard from patients and other representatives about how valproate was being used and how the risks were currently managed. The CHM noted that data from the [Medicine and Pregnancy Registry](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/mi-medicines-and-pregnancy-registry) showed that pregnancies in England continue to be exposed to valproate.

The CHM also considered other known risks of valproate, including the risk of impaired male fertility. The CHM considered pre-clinical data on possible transgenerational risks with prenatal exposure, as well as data from studies in juvenile and adult animals suggesting adverse effects on the testes. There are currently limited data available on many of these risks in humans and further studies are planned. However, the CHM noted many patients receiving valproate have other therapeutic options with fewer potential reproductive harms.

On 28 November 2023, MHRA issued a [National Patient Safety Alert](https://www.gov.uk/drug-device-alerts/national-patient-safety-alert-valproate-organisations-to-prepare-for-new-regulatory-measures-for-oversight-of-prescribing-to-new-patients-and-existing-female-patients-natpsa-slash-2023-slash-013-slash-mhra) to instruct Integrated Care Boards (in England), Health Boards (in Scotland), Health Boards (in Wales), and Health and Social Care Trusts (in Northern Ireland) to prepare for the new risk minimisation measures by 31 January 2024. The new safety and educational materials support these measures.

Due to the known significant risk of serious harm to a baby after exposure to valproate in pregnancy, these measures aim to ensure valproate is only used if other treatments are ineffective or not tolerated, and that any use of valproate in women of childbearing potential who cannot be treated with other medicines is in accordance with the Pregnancy Prevention Programme (PPP).

The CHM will consider further recent registry [data](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/valproate-re-analysis-of-study-on-risks-in-children-of-men-taking-valproate) which may suggest an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children whose fathers took valproate in the 3 months before conception. In the study, around 5 children in 100 born to fathers treated with valproate around conception were diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder. This is compared to 3 in 100 children whose fathers were taking lamotrigine or levetiracetam around conception (two other anti-seizure medicines). As a precaution male patients on valproate who are planning a family within the next year should speak to a healthcare professional about their treatment options.

See the [MHRA Public Assessment Report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/valproate-review-of-safety-data-and-expert-advice-on-management-of-risks) and [MHRA website](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/valproate-safety-measures), which will be added to in the coming weeks and months. The [MHRA review of antiepileptic drugs in pregnancy](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/antiepileptic-drugs-in-pregnancy-updated-advice-following-comprehensive-safety-review) should also be consulted.

## New Regulatory Safety and Educational Materials

To support the implementation of the new measures for valproate, the following safety and educational materials are being made available:

- Updated [Healthcare Professional Guide](https://mhra-gov.filecamp.com/s/i/eGygqKVE00FH393c): Provides updated information for healthcare professionals on the risks of valproate in pregnancy and the risks for male patients, the new conditions for valproate prescribing and key points for patient discussions.
- Updated [Patient guide](https://mhra-gov.filecamp.com/s/i/Zw7qR7wEy1YKeIEf): Provides those taking valproate (or their parent, caregiver, or responsible person) with updated information on the risks of valproate in pregnancy and the risks to male patients and what they need to do.
- Updated [Annual Risk Acknowledgement Form](https://mhra-gov.filecamp.com/s/i/6iqrRqc0zoFgeEo7): For female patients starting valproate and at annual review. Used to support and record the discussion between the patient and specialist prescriber on the risks associated with valproate in pregnancy and to record the decision of the countersigning specialist. At subsequent annual reviews only one specialist is required.
- New [Risk Acknowledgement Form for male patients starting valproate](https://mhra-gov.filecamp.com/s/i/bEnPD49yZtHsXp3M): Used to support and record the discussion between the patient and specialist prescriber of the risks associated with valproate in males when starting treatment with valproate and to record the decision of the countersigning specialist. This is only to be completed at initiation of valproate.
- [Patient card](https://mhra-gov.filecamp.com/s/i/yGUUvmiJbQFAj3Mc): Provides key information for female patients receiving valproate on contraception and pregnancy prevention.
- [Pharmacy poster](https://mhra-gov.filecamp.com/s/i/dr66W7LuRQ3pY7u5): Provides important actions for pharmacists dispensing valproate to female patients.
- [Warning stickers](https://mhra-gov.filecamp.com/s/i/T2hnHhs7A8MyvFKQ): To be added to packaging of medicine in exceptional circumstances where the original pack cannot be dispensed.

The updated product information and safety and educational materials are available on the [MHRA website](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/valproate-safety-measures) and the [electronic Medicines Compendium](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/search?q=valproate). Links to the patient guide and patient card are also available via a QR code provided in the Patient Information Leaflets for Epilim and Depakote. The Marketing Authorisation Holders are sending a letter to healthcare professionals to support these changes with the hard copies of the materials which will begin distribution next week. On receipt of the new materials, healthcare professionals should discard previous versions of the valproate materials.

## Further materials to support discussions with patients

Patients on valproate must be fully informed of the potential risks and counselled on their treatment options at the time of initial prescribing and at all subsequent reviews.

We ask clinicians to use appropriate individualised language when discussing the implications of taking valproate with patients and their caregivers.

The safety and educational materials should be used alongside other resources to support patients making decisions about valproate and other treatments for epilepsy and bipolar disorder. These include patient support tools, such as those published by the [NHS](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/decision-support-tool-is-valproate-the-right-epilepsy-treatment-for-me/) and guidelines produced by the [Association of British Neurologists.](https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.theabn.org/resource/resmgr/guidelines/abn_guidelines_for_valproate.pdf)

## Report suspected reactions on a Yellow Card

Valproate is a black triangle medicine, and all suspected adverse reactions should be reported via the Yellow Card scheme. Reports can be made of suspected reactions experienced at any time, including historic adverse experiences with medicines.

Please include in the report as much detail as possible, particularly if a side effect continued or started after treatment was stopped. Information about medical history, any concomitant medication, onset timing, treatment dates, and product brand name should also be included.

Report to the Yellow Card scheme electronically using:

- the [Yellow Card scheme website](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)
- the Yellow Card app; download from the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id990237487?pt=117756671&ct=EYC&mt=8) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.mhra.yellowcard&referrer=utm_source%3DEYC%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26anid%3Dadmob)

# Fluoroquinolone antibiotics: must now only be prescribed when other commonly recommended antibiotics are inappropriate

Systemic fluoroquinolones must now only be prescribed when other commonly recommended antibiotics are inappropriate. This follows a review by the MHRA which looked at the effectiveness of current measures to reduce the identified risk of disabling and potentially long-lasting or irreversible side effects.

Therapeutic area:[Infectious disease](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=infectious-disease)

## Advice for healthcare professionals:

- systemic (by mouth, injection, or inhalation) fluoroquinolones can cause long-lasting (up to months or years), disabling and potentially irreversible side effects, sometimes affecting multiple body systems and senses
- the UK indications for systemic fluoroquinolones have been updated so they must only be used in situations when other antibiotics, that are commonly recommended for the infection, are inappropriate
- situations in which other antibiotics are considered to be inappropriate and where a fluoroquinolone may be indicated are where:
  - there is resistance to other first-line antibiotics recommended for the infection
  - other first-line antibiotics are contraindicated in an individual patient
  - other first-line antibiotics have caused side effects in the patient requiring treatment to be stopped
  - treatment with other first-line antibiotics has failed
- this goes further than previous measures which set out that fluoroquinolones should not be prescribed for non-severe or self-limiting infections, or non-bacterial conditions, for example non-bacterial (chronic) prostatitis. These measures are still in place
- as a reminder, patients should be advised to stop fluoroquinolone treatment at the first signs of a serious adverse reaction, such as tendinitis or tendon rupture, muscle pain, muscle weakness, joint pain, joint swelling, peripheral neuropathy and central nervous system effects, and to contact their doctor immediately
- refer to MHRA’s sheet for patients ([regular print](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65aa9125c69eea0010883840/FQ_Patient_Information_Sheet_-_TO_PUBLISH.pdf) or [large print](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65aa9144ce7e9e000ff57a66/FQ_Patient_Information_Sheet_-_Large_Print_-_TO_PUBLISH.pdf)) for further advice
- remain alert to the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours with use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics. A reminder about these risks was published in the [September 2023 issue](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/fluoroquinolone-antibiotics-suicidal-thoughts-and-behaviour) of Drug Safety Update
- as a reminder of advice published in our [August 2023 issue](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/fluoroquinolone-antibiotics-reminder-of-the-risk-of-disabling-and-potentially-long-lasting-or-irreversible-side-effects) of Drug Safety Update:

  - avoid fluoroquinolone use in patients who have previously had serious adverse reactions with a quinolone antibiotic (for example, nalidixic acid) or a fluoroquinolone antibiotic
  - prescribe fluoroquinolones with special caution for people older than 60 years and for those with renal impairment or solid-organ transplants, because they are at a higher risk of tendon injury
  - avoid coadministration of a corticosteroid with a fluoroquinolone since this could exacerbate fluoroquinolone-induced tendinitis and tendon rupture
- report suspected adverse drug reactions to fluoroquinolone antibiotics on the [Yellow Card website](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/) or via the Yellow Card app (download it from the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id990237487?pt=117756671&ct=EYC&mt=8), or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.mhra.yellowcard&referrer=utm_source%3DEYC%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26anid%3Dadmob))

## Advice for healthcare professionals to give to patients and caregivers:

- fluoroquinolones are a class of antibiotics that include ciprofloxacin, delafloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and ofloxacin – these medicines may also have a brand name so patients should check the details of all antibiotics prescribed to them
- fluoroquinolone antibiotics have been reported to cause serious side effects involving tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, or mental health – in some patients, these side effects have caused long-lasting or permanent disability
- stop taking your fluoroquinolone antibiotic and contact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following signs of a side effect:
  - tendon pain or swelling – if this happens, rest the painful area until you can see your doctor
  - pain in your joints or swelling in joints such as in the shoulders, arms, or legs
  - abnormal pain or sensations (such as persistent pins and needles, tingling, tickling, numbness, or burning), weakness in the legs or arms, or difficulty walking
  - severe tiredness, depressed mood, anxiety, problems with your memory or severe problems sleeping
  - changes in your vision, taste, smell or hearing
- Tell your doctor if you have had any of the above effects at any point while taking a fluoroquinolone – this means you should avoid them in the future

## Side effects of systemic fluoroquinolones

Systemic and inhaled fluoroquinolones are associated with a risk of serious, disabling, long-lasting and potentially irreversible adverse reactions, estimated to occur in at least between 1 and 10 people in every 10,000 who take a fluoroquinolone. These may affect multiple body systems and include musculoskeletal, nervous, psychiatric and sensory reactions. These adverse reactions have been reported in patients irrespective of their age and potential risk factors.

Patients have reported that experiencing long-lasting or disabling reactions can affect their mental health, particularly when they perceive healthcare professionals fail to adequately acknowledge the reactions or the possibility that they are associated with a fluoroquinolone. Tendon damage can occur within 48 hours of commencing treatment, or the effects can be delayed for several months and become apparent after stopping treatment.

There are no proven drug treatments for these side effects. However, it is important that fluoroquinolones are stopped immediately at the first signs of a musculoskeletal, neurological or psychiatric side effect, such as those described above to avoid further exposure, which could potentially worsen adverse reactions. These symptoms should be appropriately investigated.

## MHRA review and further limits to the use of fluoroquinolones

[Restrictions to the use of fluoroquinolones](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/fluoroquinolone-antibiotics-new-restrictions-and-precautions-for-use-due-to-very-rare-reports-of-disabling-and-potentially-long-lasting-or-irreversible-side-effects) were introduced in 2019 to minimise the risk of these reactions. The MHRA has reviewed the effectiveness of these measures in the UK and sought the advice of the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM). As a result of this review a reminder about these risks was published in the [August 2023 issue](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/fluoroquinolone-antibiotics-reminder-of-the-risk-of-disabling-and-potentially-long-lasting-or-irreversible-side-effects) of Drug Safety Update.

The MHRA has now taken additional regulatory action to update the indications for all systemic fluoroquinolones to state they should only be used when other commonly recommended antibiotics are inappropriate. Situations where other antibiotics are considered to be inappropriate are where:

- there is resistance to other first-line antibiotics recommended for the infection
- other first-line antibiotics are contraindicated in an individual patient
- other first-line antibiotics have caused side effects in the patient requiring treatment to be stopped
- treatment with other first-line antibiotics has failed

The description of disabling and potentially long-lasting or irreversible side effects in the safety information has also been updated, to include more detail about the range of psychiatric symptoms that may occur as part of these reactions. These may include sleep disorders, anxiety, panic attacks, confusion or depression. While the frequency of disabling and potentially long-lasting or irreversible side effects cannot be estimated precisely using available data, the updated reporting incidence indicates a minimum frequency of between 1 and 10 per 10,000 patients.

## Report any suspected adverse drug reactions

Please continue to report suspected adverse drug reactions to fluoroquinolones via the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/). Your report will help us safeguard public health.

# Omega-3-acid ethyl ester medicines (Omacor/Teromeg 1000mg capsules): dose-dependent increased risk of atrial fibrillation in patients with established cardiovascular diseases or cardiovascular risk factors

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials have highlighted a dose-dependent increased risk of atrial fibrillation in patients with established cardiovascular diseases or cardiovascular risk factors treated with omega-3-acid ethyl ester medicines compared to placebo.

From:[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency)Published22 January 2024

Therapeutic area:[Cardiovascular disease and lipidology](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=cardiovascular-disease-lipidology) and [Nutrition and dietetics](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=nutrition-dietetics)

## Advice for healthcare professionals:

- atrial fibrillation is now listed as an adverse drug reaction with a “common” frequency (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) for medicines containing omega-3-acid ethyl esters licensed for the treatment of hypertriglyceridaemia
- the observed risk was found to be highest with a dose of 4 g/day
- advise patients taking omega-3-acid ethyl ester medicines for the treatment of hypertriglyceridaemia to seek medical attention if they develop symptoms of atrial fibrillation
- if a patient develops atrial fibrillation whilst taking these medicines for the treatment of hypertriglyceridaemia then the medicine should be discontinued permanently
- report suspected adverse drug reactions associated with omega-3-acid ethyl ester medicines on a [Yellow Card](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard)

## Advice for healthcare professionals to give to patients and carers:

- medicinal products containing omega-3 ethyl esters are licensed for the reduction of high triglyceride levels (hypertriglyceridaemia) after changes to diet have not worked
- very high levels of triglycerides in the blood can cause problems such as increasing the risk of coronary heart disease and causing inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)
- before taking an omega-3-acid ethyl ester medicine, inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are currently experiencing heart problems or have a history of heart problems
- talk to your doctor if you experience palpitations, dizziness, shortness of breath and tiredness as these may be symptoms of an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation)
- do not stop your hypertriglyceridaemia treatment without first discussing this with your doctor

## Review of atrial fibrillation associated with omega-3-acid ethyl ester medicines

A recent European regulatory [review](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/meeting-highlights-pharmacovigilance-risk-assessment-committee-prac-25-28-september-2023) recommended “atrial fibrillation” should be listed as a common adverse reaction (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) in the product information of medicines containing omega-3-acid ethyl esters. The review of safety and efficacy data for omega-3 acid ethyl ester medicines licensed for the treatment of hypertriglyceridaemia considered a dose-dependent increased risk of atrial fibrillation which had been identified by several meta-analyses of large randomised controlled trials (RCTs). These trials investigated the effect on cardiovascular outcomes compared with placebo enrolling more than 80,000 patients, mostly with cardiovascular diseases or cardiovascular risk factors. [\[footnote 1\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/omega-3-acid-ethyl-ester-medicines-omacor-slash-teromeg-1000mg-capsules-dose-dependent-increased-risk-of-atrial-fibrillation-in-patients-with-established-cardiovascular-diseases-or-cardiovascular-risk-factors#fn:1)[\[footnote 2\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/omega-3-acid-ethyl-ester-medicines-omacor-slash-teromeg-1000mg-capsules-dose-dependent-increased-risk-of-atrial-fibrillation-in-patients-with-established-cardiovascular-diseases-or-cardiovascular-risk-factors#fn:2)[\[footnote 3\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/omega-3-acid-ethyl-ester-medicines-omacor-slash-teromeg-1000mg-capsules-dose-dependent-increased-risk-of-atrial-fibrillation-in-patients-with-established-cardiovascular-diseases-or-cardiovascular-risk-factors#fn:3) The frequency of atrial fibrillation was determined as “common” since, from this data, the incidence would be 3.9%.

The findings of this review were considered by the Pharmacovigilance Expert Advisory Committee (PEAG) of the [Commission on Human Medicines](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/commission-on-human-medicines/about/membership) (CHM), which agreed with the recommendations of European regulators to update the product information. A letter has been sent to UK healthcare professionals. The PEAG also recommended issuing a Drug Safety Update to inform healthcare professionals and patients about the new information.

The product information recommends permanent discontinuation of treatment for patients who develop atrial fibrillation whilst taking these medicines for hypertriglyceridaemia. Clinical judgment and assessment of the individual benefits and risks to the patient should be taken into consideration before any decision to stop treatment.

The PEAG noted that, in the case of patients with a previous or current diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, the Product Information does not provide specific advice or contraindicate use of these medicines.

## Omega-3 dietary sources and supplements

The MHRA does not regulate food or dietary supplements that are marketed without reference to a medicinal effect/claim. Neither the randomised controlled trials or the review evaluated dietary consumption of fish and other foods rich in omega-3 nor supplements, and we are unable to give advice on the risk in individuals who consume dietary omega-3 supplements without a known history of cardiovascular disease or significant cardiovascular risk factors.

## Reports of atrial fibrillation with omega-3-containing products

Up to 13 November 2023, the MHRA has not received any Yellow Card reports describing atrial fibrillation in association with a medicinal product containing omega-3 acids as the active substance.
Atrial fibrillation is an abnormal heart rhythm characterised by a fast irregularly irregular heart rate. Symptoms of atrial fibrillation include palpitations, dizziness, shortness of breath and tiredness. If untreated it can cause formation of blood clots in the heart which may travel to the brain (embolise), leading to a stroke.

## Other omega 3 ethyl ester medicines

Vazkepa (icosapent ethyl) authorised in 2021 is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in adult statin-treated patients at high cardiovascular risk with elevated triglycerides (≥ 150 mg/dL \[≥ 1.7 mmol/L\]) and established cardiovascular disease, or diabetes, and at least one other cardiovascular risk factor. Icosapent ethyl is a stable ethyl ester of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). At time of initial authorisation of this medicinal product, atrial fibrillation/flutter was listed as a common adverse drug reaction. The incidence of atrial fibrillation/flutter was 5.8% of subjects receiving icosapent ethyl in a placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcomes trial compared with 4.5% in subjects receiving placebo.

Several parenteral infusion products that contain omega 3 acid triglycerides or omega-3 fish oil are licensed as prescription only medicines in the UK. These products do not currently list atrial fibrillation as a recognised adverse drug reaction. At this time they are not directly impacted by the regulatory action that has been taken.

## Report suspected drug reactions on a Yellow Card

Healthcare professionals prescribing aripiprazole are reminded to be alert to the risk of addictive gambling and other impulse control disorders. Healthcare professionals should advise patients, their families and friends to be alert to these risks.

From:[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency)Published18 December 2023

Therapeutic area:[Psychiatry](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=psychiatry)

## Advice for healthcare professionals:

- there has been an increase in the number of Yellow Card reports of gambling disorder and pathological gambling associated with aripiprazole use; concerns have also been raised about a lack of awareness of this issue
- the UK reports occurred in patients with and without a prior history of gambling disorder and the majority were reported to resolve upon reduction of dose or stopping treatment with aripiprazole
- advise patients and their caregivers to be alert to the development of new or increased urges to gamble and other impulse control symptoms, such as excessive eating or spending, or an abnormally high sex drive
- consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops these symptoms
- awareness of this risk must increase among patients and prescribers, as gambling is recognised as a common risk factor linked to suicide and is included within the [suicide prevention in England: 5-year cross sector strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/suicide-prevention-strategy-for-england-2023-to-2028/suicide-prevention-in-england-5-year-cross-sector-strategy)
- report suspected adverse drug reactions associated with aripiprazole on a [Yellow Card](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)

## Advice for healthcare professionals to provide to patients:

- aripiprazole is a medicine that helps with the management of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder
- do not stop taking aripiprazole without first discussing this with your doctor
- before taking aripiprazole, inform your doctor if you have any personal history of excessive gambling behaviour or impulse control disorders
- tell your doctor if you or your family or friends notice that you are developing urges or cravings to behave in ways that are unusual for you, including behaviours such as addictive gambling, excessive eating or spending, or an abnormally high sex drive

## Review of pathological gambling associated with aripiprazole

Aripiprazole belongs to a class of medicines called antipsychotics. Aripiprazole has 3 approved indications: treatment of schizophrenia in adults and adolescents aged over 15 years; short-term treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adults and adolescents aged 13 years and older; and prevention of a new manic episode in adults who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment.

The MHRA has received reports from stakeholders raising concerns about a lack of awareness of the association between aripiprazole and the development or worsening of addictive gambling behaviours. Since the beginning of 2023, there has been an increased number of Yellow Card reports for aripiprazole which include gambling, gambling disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder.

A review of the available evidence was considered by the Neurology, Pain and Psychiatry expert advisory group (NPPEAG) of the [Commission on Human Medicines (CHM)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/commission-on-human-medicines/about/membership) . The NPPEAG noted that the [Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC)](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/8954/smpc#about-medicine) and the [Patient Information Leaflet (PIL)](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/8954/pil#about-medicine) for aripiprazole contain information regarding pathological gambling and other impulse control disorders. The SmPC states that impulse control disorders may result in harm to the patient and others if not recognised and advises consideration of dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops increased urges while taking aripiprazole. In reviewing this issue, the NPPEAG recommended that the MHRA remind healthcare professionals and patients of these risks.

## UK reports of pathological gambling and gambling disorder with aripiprazole

From 30 June 2009 to 28 August 2023, the MHRA received 69 Yellow Card reports citing aripiprazole as a suspect medicine for side effects of gambling or gambling disorder. Thirty-two of these reports were received in 2023. Fourteen reports were also received describing obsessive-compulsive disorders, or related symptoms, with aripiprazole. Aripiprazole is a frequently prescribed antipsychotic medication and usage has been steadily increasing over the past four years. [\[footnote 1\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/aripiprazole-abilify-and-generic-brands-risk-of-pathological-gambling#fn:1)It is not possible to determine the frequency of these side effects from the currently available data.

Across the 69 reports of gambling and gambling disorder, most reports concerned people aged 20 to 40 years, although there were reports in patients up to 60 years of age. In many cases the patients had no previous history of gambling behaviour. Eight of the cases described patients who had lost significant sums of money and accrued considerable debts. In the majority of cases, cessation of aripiprazole led to a marked reduction or total loss of impulses to gamble. Several of the cases mention that the patient was not aware of this side effect. Awareness of this risk must increase among patients and prescribers, as gambling is recognised as a common risk factor linked to suicide and is included within the [suicide prevention in England: 5-year cross sector strategy.](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/suicide-prevention-strategy-for-england-2023-to-2028/suicide-prevention-in-england-5-year-cross-sector-strategy)

# Vitamin B12 (hydroxocobalamin, cyanocobalamin): advise patients with known cobalt allergy to be vigilant for sensitivity reactions

The medicines used to treat vitamin B12 deficiency (hydroxocobalamin, cyanocobalamin) contain cobalt. There are case reports in the literature describing cobalt sensitivity-type reactions in patients being treated for vitamin B12 deficiency.

From:[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency)Published18 December 2023

Therapeutic area:[Dermatology](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=dermatology) and [Immunology and vaccination](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=immunology-vaccination)

Healthcare professionals prescribing vitamin B12 products to patients with known cobalt allergy should advise patients to be vigilant for signs and symptoms of cobalt sensitivity and treat as appropriate.

## Advice for healthcare professionals:

- cobalt sensitivity reactions typically present with cutaneous symptoms of chronic or subacute allergic contact dermatitis. Infrequently, cobalt allergy may trigger an erythema multiforme-like reaction. Symptom onset may be immediate or delayed up to 72 hours post-administration
- cobalt allergy is estimated to affect 1 to 3% of the general population 1[\[footnote 1\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/vitamin-b12-hydroxocobalamin-cyanocobalamin-advise-patients-with-known-cobalt-allergy-to-be-vigilant-for-sensitivity-reactions#fn:1).
- if cobalt sensitivity-type reactions occur, assess the individual benefits and risks of continuing treatment and, if necessary to continue, advise patients on appropriate management of symptoms
- report suspected adverse drug reactions to the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)

## Advice for healthcare professionals to provide to patients:

- hydroxocobalamin and cyanocobalamin are forms of vitamin B12 which are used to treat vitamin B12 deficiency; hydroxocobalamin is available in injectable form only, while cyanocobalamin is available in oral and injectable forms
- as vitamin B12 contains cobalt, patients with known cobalt allergy are advised to speak to a doctor or healthcare professional if they are prescribed vitamin B12
- patients with known cobalt allergy should be alert for symptoms of cobalt sensitivity-type reactions following administration of vitamin B12 products for vitamin B12 deficiency
- talk to a doctor or healthcare professional if you are given or are taking vitamin B12 and you develop allergic skin reactions such as a rash or hives
- seek urgent medical care if you experience symptoms of a serious allergic reaction (with symptoms such as extensive or blistering rash, wheeze, difficulty breathing, feeling faint)

## Review of vitamin B12 and cobalt allergy

Hydroxocobalamin and cyanocobalamin are oral and injectable forms of vitamin B12 that are used to treat vitamin B12 deficiency. Endogenous vitamin B12 and these medicines contain a cobalt component.

The MHRA received a query from a member of the public, as part of a report to the Yellow Card scheme of a suspected reaction associated with vitamin B12 treatment and cobalt allergy. As a result of this, we conducted a review of this topic.

There is evidence within the literature of cobalt sensitivity reactions occurring following administration of vitamin B12. Additionally, the MHRA received three Yellow Card reports including the case described above, which report vitamin B12 as a suspect drug and possible allergic reactions to cobalt. Following the MHRA’s review, it was considered appropriate to improve awareness that hydroxocobalamin and cyanocobalamin medicines contain cobalt.

We have subsequently requested relevant Marketing Authorisation Holders (MAHs) to update the [Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC)](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/4341/smpc) to include that vitamin B12 contains cobalt. We have also requested MAHs to update the [Patient Information Leaflet (PIL)](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/4341/pil) to advise patients that cobalt is contained within vitamin B12 and that they should talk to a healthcare professional if they have a known cobalt allergy.

## Characteristics of cobalt sensitivity reactions and their management

Patients with a cobalt sensitivity may present with cutaneous symptoms such as chronic or subacute allergic contact dermatitis. Cobalt allergy may also trigger an erythema multiforme-like eruption. [\[footnote 2\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/vitamin-b12-hydroxocobalamin-cyanocobalamin-advise-patients-with-known-cobalt-allergy-to-be-vigilant-for-sensitivity-reactions#fn:2)The hypersensitivity reaction may be immediate or delayed to 12 to 72 hours following exposure. [\[footnote 3\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/vitamin-b12-hydroxocobalamin-cyanocobalamin-advise-patients-with-known-cobalt-allergy-to-be-vigilant-for-sensitivity-reactions#fn:3)[\[footnote 4\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/vitamin-b12-hydroxocobalamin-cyanocobalamin-advise-patients-with-known-cobalt-allergy-to-be-vigilant-for-sensitivity-reactions#fn:4) Additional vigilance may be required beyond this time period.

There is no alternative treatment for vitamin B12 deficiency, therefore, vitamin B12 use is not contraindicated in patients with cobalt allergy that presents only as cutaneous symptoms. However, where previous serious allergic reaction is established in known cobalt allergy patients, individual assessment of the benefits and risks should be conducted before starting treatment.

Hydroxocobalamin products which are indicated in the treatment of known or suspected cyanide poisoning are excluded from these precautions, considering it is a medical emergency in which the potentially life-saving benefit of treatment would outweigh the risk of allergic reaction.

Patients and carers should be reminded about the symptoms of cobalt sensitivity and to seek medical advice if they experience these symptoms. Symptoms should be monitored and treated as clinically appropriate.

## Report suspected reactions on a Yellow Card

Please continue to report suspected adverse drug reactions to nitrofurantoin via the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/). Your report will help us safeguard public health.
Healthcare professionals, patients, and caregivers are asked to submit reports using the Yellow Card scheme electronically using:

- the [Yellow Card website](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)

- the Yellow Card app; download from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yellow-card-mhra/id990237487) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.mhra.yellowcard&referrer=utm_source%3DEYC%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26anid%3Dadmob)

- some clinical IT systems for healthcare professionals (EMIS, SystmOne, Vision, MiDatabank, and Ulysses)

# Letters and medicine recalls sent to healthcare professionals in November 2023

A summary of recent letters and notifications sent to healthcare professionals about medicines and medical devices, and a recent National Patient Safety Alert asking organisations to put a plan in place to implement new regulatory measures for valproate.

From:[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency)Published18 December 2023

## Valproate National Patient Safety Alert

On 28 November 2023, we issued a [National Patient Safety Alert](https://www.gov.uk/drug-device-alerts/national-patient-safety-alert-valproate-organisations-to-prepare-for-new-regulatory-measures-for-oversight-of-prescribing-to-new-patients-and-existing-female-patients-natpsa-slash-2023-slash-013-slash-mhra) that asked organisations to put a plan in place to implement new regulatory measures for sodium valproate, valproic acid and valproate semisodium (valproate).

This follows a comprehensive review of safety data, advice from the Commission on Human Medicines and an expert group, and liaison with clinicians and organisations. Due to the known significant risk of serious harm to a baby after exposure to valproate in pregnancy, these measures aim to ensure valproate is only used if other treatments are ineffective or not tolerated, and that any use of valproate in women of childbearing potential who cannot be treated with other medicines is in accordance with the [Pregnancy Prevention Programme.](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/valproate-reminder-of-current-pregnancy-prevention-programme-requirements-information-on-new-safety-measures-to-be-introduced-in-the-coming-months#:~:text=Patients%20currently%20taking%20valproate%20must,talk%20to%20a%20specialist%20urgently.)

From January 2024, valproate must not be started in new patients (male or female) younger than 55 years, unless two specialists independently consider and document that there is no other effective or tolerated treatment, or unless there are compelling reasons that the reproductive risks do not apply.

Clinicians should discuss the current warnings and upcoming measures relating to valproate with their patients and consider together how it affects the patient’s individual circumstances. See the [Public Assessment Report for the full review of safety data and expert advice on management of the risks.](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/valproate-review-of-safety-data-and-expert-advice-on-management-of-risks)

## Medicine Recalls and Notifications

In November 2023, recalls and notifications for medicines were issued on:

[Class 3 Medicines Recall: AstraZeneca UK Ltd., Fluenz Tetra nasal spray suspension, EL(23)A/39](https://www.gov.uk/drug-device-alerts/class-3-medicines-recall-astrazeneca-uk-ltd-dot-fluenz-tetra-nasal-spray-suspension-el-23-a-slash-39) : Issued 30 November 2023. AstraZeneca UK Ltd has informed the MHRA that, following routine stability analysis, the printed expiry dates for named batches of Fluenz Tetra nasal spray suspension are incorrect. As a precautionary measure, the expiry dates need to be reduced by up to 5 days. Healthcare professionals are advised to continue using the vaccine as directed. The vaccines may be administered safely up until the amended expiry date. After the amended expiry date, any unused products should be quarantined for return.

## Medical Device Safety Information

We recently published Device Safety Information pages on the following topics:

[Specific brands of carbomer eye gel: recall of AACARB eye gel, AACOMER eye gel and PUROPTICS eye gel: potential risk of infection, DSI/2023/11](https://www.gov.uk/drug-device-alerts/specific-brands-of-carbomer-eye-gel-recall-of-aacarb-eye-gel-aacomer-eye-gel-and-puroptics-eye-gel-potential-risk-of-infection-dsi-slash-2023-slash-11) : Issued 24 November 2023. An investigation by UKHSA has identified a potential association of a Burkholderia cenocepacia bacterial contamination with the named eye gels. As a precautionary measure these eye gels are being recalled. UKHSA considers the risk to the public from Burkholderia cenocepacia to be very low, but some patient groups are at higher risk of adverse effects. Therefore, as a precautionary measure, the UKHSA has recommended all carbomer containing eye gels are avoided in individuals with cystic fibrosis, patients cared for in critical settings (e.g. intensive care), severely immunocompromised individuals, and those awaiting lung transplantation.

Healthcare professionals are advised to follow the actions in the [field safety notice](https://mhra-gov.filecamp.com/s/d/1cMNsRZ3uIX9Zi32) including stopping supply or prescription of the named eye gels to all patients/customers (supplied from August to November). For additional information please refer to the [Device Safety Information page.](https://www.gov.uk/drug-device-alerts?alert_type%5B%5D=device-safety-information)

# Ozempic▼(semaglutide) and Saxenda (liraglutide): vigilance required due to potentially harmful falsified products

Falsified, potentially harmful Ozempic▼ and Saxenda products have been found in the UK.

From:[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency)Published23 November 2023

Therapeutic area:[Endocrinology, diabetology and metabolism](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=endocrinology-diabetology-metabolism) and [Nutrition and dietetics](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=nutrition-dietetics)

We ask healthcare professionals to remind patients using these products to always obtain prescription medicines from a qualified healthcare provider and not to use products they suspect are falsified as this may lead to serious health consequences. We also ask healthcare professionals to remain vigilant for symptoms linked to hypoglycaemia in patients who may have obtained a falsified product containing insulin.

## Advice for healthcare professionals:

- be aware that falsified Ozempic and Saxenda products have been found in the UK, including falsified pens containing insulin, which may lead to patient harm
- remain vigilant for symptoms linked to hypoglycaemia in patients who may have obtained a falsified product and provide appropriate treatment for any patient who may have inadvertently administered insulin via these products
- if you encounter a suspected falsified product, quarantine it and report to the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)
- advise patients who are concerned that the pens they have purchased might be falsified that they should not use the pens and report as mentioned above
- Ozempic and Saxenda from legitimate supply chains are unaffected

## Advice for healthcare professionals to give to patients and the public:

- you must not use Ozempic and Saxenda products or pens that you suspect are falsified as this may lead to serious health consequences
- check the [Patient Information Leaflet for Ozempic](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/files/pil.9750.pdf) and [Patient Information Leaflet for Saxenda](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/files/pil.2313.pdf) to clarify what the genuine pens look like. Do not use any products that appear suspicious – [an example image of a fake Ozempic pen is available in the MHRA’s advice to the public](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mhra-warns-of-unsafe-fake-weight-loss-pens)
- falsified Ozempic and Saxenda pens may contain insulin – seek urgent medical attention if you experience symptoms of low blood sugar, which includes feeling dizzy, sweating or blurred vision; take the suspected fake medicine with you so your doctors know what may have caused this
- if more severe symptoms of low blood sugar occur, such as seizures (fits) and loss of consciousness, call 999 immediately
- If obtaining a private prescription (from a non-NHS prescriber), ensure that this is from authorised sources, such as registered online pharmacies, to avoid the risk of receiving falsified pens
- report suspected falsified Saxenda or Ozempic pens to the MHRA’s [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)

## Background

[Saxenda](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/2313/smpc#gref) (liraglutide) is indicated for weight management in adult patients with obesity or people who are overweight and have at least one weight-related comorbidity. Ozempic (semaglutide) has been authorised for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Ozempic is not authorised for weight loss, but is used off-label for that purpose.

We remind healthcare professionals of the advice in the [National Patient Safety Alert of July 2023](https://www.cas.mhra.gov.uk/ViewandAcknowledgment/ViewAlert.aspx?AlertID=103235) and a [letter to healthcare professionals](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/651196ffbf7c1a0011bb46a0/Ozempic.pdf) on actions to mitigate the supply shortage caused by an increase in demand for these products for licensed and off-label indications.

## Seizures of falsified products

Up to October 2023 the MHRA has seized 369 potentially falsified Ozempic pens. None were seized before January 2023. We have also received reports of falsified Saxenda pens that have been obtained by members of the public in the UK through non-legitimate routes (any route that does not require a prescription from a qualified prescribing healthcare professional).

We ask healthcare professionals to remind patients and the public to only obtain prescription-only medicines from legal pharmacies and with a prescription from a qualified healthcare professional.

With any medicines bought outside of the legal supply chain, the contents may not match the ingredients on the label. Pens containing insulin, which have been relabelled as Ozempic, have been intercepted in the UK.

All pharmacies in Great Britain, including those online, must be registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council [(GPhC)](https://www.pharmacyregulation.org/) and meet their standards for registered pharmacies.

Advise patients that the legitimacy of a pharmacy can be verified by referring to the [GPhC website pharmacy registry](https://www.pharmacyregulation.org/) and checking that the pharmacy is listed there.

The [MHRA’s FakeMeds](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mhra-warns-of-unsafe-fake-weight-loss-pens) website also provides tools and resources to direct patients to.

## Reports of harm

Up to 20 November 2023, the MHRA has received 16 reports to the Yellow Card scheme of the purchase or use of products supposedly containing semaglutide or liraglutide products that were suspected to be falsified. Some of these reports have now been confirmed as falsified medicines.

Five cases reported that the Saxenda and Ozempic pens were confirmed to be falsified with insulin. Some of the recipients were hospitalised and required urgent care. Serious side effects reported in those hospitalised, including hypoglycaemic shock, indicate that the pens may contain insulin rather than semaglutide.

## Reporting concerns and side effects

Healthcare professionals, patients and the public can report suspected falsified products to the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/). Please include in the report as much detail as possible, including if any side effects were experienced following consumption.

Healthcare professionals should quarantine suspected falsified products and retain the product for testing.

Ozempic is a black triangle medicine and therefore all suspected adverse reactions, even those with the legitimate licensed product, should be reported via the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/).

Please include in the report as much detail as possible, particularly if a side effect continued or started after treatment was stopped. Information about medical history, any concomitant medication, onset timing, treatment dates, and product brand name should also be included.

Report to the Yellow Card scheme electronically using:

- the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/) website
- the Yellow Card app; download from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yellow-card-mhra/id990237487) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.mhra.yellowcard&referrer=utm_source%3DEYC%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26anid%3Dadmob)

# Nirmatrelvir, ritonavir (Paxlovid▼): be alert to the risk of drug interactions with ritonavir

There is a risk of harmful drug interactions with the ritonavir component of the COVID-19 treatment Paxlovid▼ due to its inhibition of the enzyme CYP3A, which metabolises many commonly used drugs. Prescribers should obtain a detailed patient history of current medications before prescribing Paxlovid, checking the Paxlovid product information for known and potential drug interactions.

From:[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency)Published23 November 2023

Therapeutic area:[Immunology and vaccination](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=immunology-vaccination), [Infectious disease](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=infectious-disease) and [Respiratory disease and allergy](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=respiratory-disease-allergy)

### Advice for healthcare professionals:

- there is a risk of potentially serious drug interactions with the ritonavir component of Paxlovid leading to increased toxicity from, or reduced effectiveness of concomitant medications
- ritonavir is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor that acts to boost the plasma levels of the nirmatrelvir component of Paxlovid by preventing its degradation; as many commonly used drugs are metabolised by CYP3A4, the risk of harmful drug interactions with Paxlovid is significant
- drug interactions may also reduce the effectiveness of Paxlovid, in the treatment of COVID-19
- obtain a thorough history of patients’ current medications, including over the counter (OTC) medications, herbal remedies and illicit or recreational drug use
- refer to the Paxlovid Summary of Product Characteristics [(SmPC)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-paxlovid/summary-of-product-characteristics-for-paxlovid) (especially sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5) before prescribing Paxlovid to check for contraindications and potential interactions – links to other resources to assist with this are available below
- remind patients to read the Patient Information Leaflet [(PIL)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-paxlovid/patient-information-leaflet-for-paxlovid) and to be vigilant for any adverse reactions, seeking medical advice when required
- report suspected adverse drug reactions associated with Paxlovid on a [Yellow Card](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)

### Advice for healthcare professionals to provide to patiens:

- Paxlovid is used to treat COVID-19 infection in patients at risk of developing severe disease
- Paxlovid is an antiviral medicine composed of 2 drugs called ritonavir and nirmatrelvir
- ritonavir can affect how other medicines work, potentially leading to harmful effects
- because of this risk, your doctor or healthcare provider should ask you detailed questions about which medicines you are currently taking before prescribing Paxlovid and it is important that you mention all medicines that you use, including over the counter (without prescription) medicines, herbal remedies and any recreational drug use
- it is important not to change or stop taking any medications before discussing this with a healthcare professional
- please read the [leaflet](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-paxlovid/patient-information-leaflet-for-paxlovid) that accompanies your medicine and be vigilant for any side effects
- if you are concerned about a potential side effect after taking Paxlovid or any other medication, seek advice from a healthcare professional and submit a [Yellow Card](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)

### Risk of adverse drug interactions with Paxlovid

Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid 150mg/100mg film-coated tablets) is an anti-viral treatment that is indicated for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19.

Paxlovid should be given as soon as possible after positive results of SARS-CoV-2 viral testing and within 5 days of onset of symptoms. The approved dose is 300mg nirmatrelvir (two 150mg tablets) with 100mg ritonavir (one 100mg tablet) all taken together, orally twice daily, for 5 days.

Prescribing of Paxlovid to [eligible patients in England](https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/letter-to-patients-important-information-about-treatments-for-covid-2/) has recently transferred from Covid Medicines Delivery Units (CMDUs) to primary care providers. The MHRA sought advice from members of the COVID-19 Therapeutics Expert Working Group (EWG) and Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) in February 2022 about communicating the risks of drug interactions with Paxlovid via a DSU article. The publication of a DSU was supported by members of the CHM and the EWG in the event of Paxlovid deployment becoming more widespread.

The ritonavir component of Paxlovid is not active against SARS-CoV-2 but inhibits the CYP3A-mediated metabolism of nirmatrelvir (the active antiviral), thereby increasing plasma concentrations of nirmatrelvir. It is this CYP3A inhibitory activity of ritonavir that poses a risk of harmful drug interactions with Paxlovid.

Harmful interactions can occur with many medicines. Section 4.3 of the [(SmPC)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-paxlovid/summary-of-product-characteristics-for-paxlovid) lists all the drugs with which Paxlovid is contraindicated and must not be co-administered, including commonly-used medicines such as analgesics, antibiotics and antihistamines, and more specialized treatments such as antianginal drugs, anticancer drugs and anticonvulsants. Use of Paxlovid with these medicines may lead to serious or life-threatening side effects.

Section 4.5 of the [(SmPC)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-paxlovid/summary-of-product-characteristics-for-paxlovid) lists medicines which may lead to potentially significant interactions with Paxlovid, and where Paxlovid should be considered only if the benefits outweigh the risks.

Healthcare professionals must review these sections of the [(SmPC)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-paxlovid/summary-of-product-characteristics-for-paxlovid) in detail before prescribing Paxlovid.

The risks of potential drug interactions when taking Paxlovid, and what actions to take if an adverse event occurs, should be explained to patients by the prescriber. Paxlovid is also contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivities to nirmatrelvir, ritonavir or any of the listed excipients, and in patients with severe renal and / or hepatic impairment.

Patients should be reminded to read the Patient Information Leaflet [(PIL)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-paxlovid/patient-information-leaflet-for-paxlovid) and speak to a healthcare professional if they have questions.

### Resources to assist prescribers of Paxlovid

There are several online resources available to aid in the safe prescribing of Paxlovid1[\[footnote 1\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/nirmatrelvir-ritonavir-paxlovidv-be-alert-to-the-risk-of-drug-interactions-with-ritonavir#fn:1):

[Specialist Pharmacy Service (SPS): Using nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid) in practice](https://www.sps.nhs.uk/articles/using-nirmatrelvir-and-ritonavir-paxlovid-in-practice/) sets out comprehensive information on checking interacting medicines as well as other safety-related issues. This guidance also includes links to specific patient information, including:

- NHS.UK Medicines A-Z: has a monograph for [Paxlovid](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/paxlovid/) that includes a section on ‘ [Taking Paxlovid with other medicines and herbal supplements](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/paxlovid/taking-paxlovid-with-other-medicines-and-herbal-supplements/)’.

The SPS clinical enquiry answering service supports primary care healthcare professionals in England with questions about Paxlovid. Contact details can be found via [Medicines Advice contact details – SPS - Specialist Pharmacy Service – The first stop for professional medicines advice](https://www.sps.nhs.uk/home/about-sps/get-in-touch/medicines-information-services-contact-details/).

In addition, the University of Liverpool hosts several online resources which provide information about the safe prescribing of Paxlovid, such as the [Liverpool COVID-19 Interaction Checker](https://www.covid19-druginteractions.org/checker). The University has also created a flowchart to aid prescribers in the identification of potential unsafe prescribing regarding patient concomitant medications. You can access the flowchart by selecting the first link under the heading ‘Resources for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid; 5 day administration)’ available on this page: [Liverpool COVID-19 Interactions (covid19-druginteractions.org)](https://www.covid19-druginteractions.org/prescribing_resources).

### Report any suspected adverse drug reactions

Please continue to report suspected adverse drug reactions to Paxlovid via the Yellow Card scheme. Your report will help us safeguard public health. Healthcare professionals, patients, and caregivers are asked to submit reports using the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/) electronically using:

- the [Yellow Card website](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)
- the Yellow Card app; download from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yellow-card-mhra/id990237487) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.mhra.yellowcard&referrer=utm_source%3DEYC%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26anid%3Dadmob)
- some clinical IT systems for healthcare professionals (EMIS, SystmOne, Vision, MiDatabank, and Ulysses)

When reporting, please provide as much information as possible, including information about batch numbers, medical history, any concomitant medication, onset timing, treatment dates, and product brand name.

# E-cigarette use or vaping: reminder to remain vigilant for suspected adverse reactions and safety concerns and report them to the Yellow Card scheme

Healthcare professionals should be vigilant for suspected adverse reactions and safety concerns associated with e-cigarettes and e-liquids, commonly known as vapes. Please report adverse reactions to the Yellow Card scheme and promote vigilance among patients.

From:[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency)Published23 November 2023

Therapeutic area:[Respiratory disease and allergy](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=respiratory-disease-allergy)

The MHRA is responsible for assessing whether the manufacturer or submitter has met the requirements in their notification for nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and e-liquids before the product comes to market. Trading Standards are responsible for enforcing the safety and quality of nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and e-liquids once they have been supplied to the UK market. The MHRA is also responsible for collecting and monitoring information about safety concerns related to these products through the Yellow Card Scheme.

## Advice for healthcare professionals:

- document use of e-cigarette products, commonly referred to as ’vapes’ and ‘vaping’ in the medical records for all patients when taking a medical history (see [Document e-cigarette use in medical records](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/e-cigarette-use-or-vaping-reminder-to-remain-vigilant-for-suspected-adverse-reactions-and-safety-concerns-and-report-them-to-the-yellow-card-scheme#document))
- advise patients to be vigilant about suspected adverse reactions that occur after the use of e-cigarettes and e-liquids
- advise patients to purchase and use legally compliant e-cigarette and e-liquid products
- report any suspected adverse reactions or safety concerns to the [Yellow Card Scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/) and include as many details as possible to ensure the MHRA can continue to perform safety vigilance

## Advice for healthcare professionals to give to patients:

- continuous reviews by the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID) have found that whilst not risk-free, vaping (e-cigarette use) is significantly less harmful than smoking and is one of the most effective tools to help adults quit smoking
- only purchase and use ‘notified’ products from reputable retailers; check if a product has been notified to the MHRA and meets the minimum requirements for supply in the UK by verifying if the product is present in the MHRA ECIG Publications List (see [Advice for consumers](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/e-cigarette-use-or-vaping-reminder-to-remain-vigilant-for-suspected-adverse-reactions-and-safety-concerns-and-report-them-to-the-yellow-card-scheme#advice))
- talk to your doctor, a stop-smoking advisor or another healthcare professional if you experience any side effects or have any concerns about the product you are using
- report any side effects or safety concerns that you have to the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/) and provide as much information as possible to help the MHRA assess your report

## E-cigarette use in the UK

The UK Government’s [Smokefree 2030 plan for England](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/smokers-urged-to-swap-cigarettes-for-vapes-in-world-first-scheme), which aims to reduce the prevalence of tobacco smoking and its associated harms, encourages adult smokers to seek safer alternatives to smoking. As part of this, a new ‘Swap to Stop’ scheme has been announced which promotes replacing tobacco cigarettes with e-cigarettes to support smokers to quit. [\[footnote 1\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/e-cigarette-use-or-vaping-reminder-to-remain-vigilant-for-suspected-adverse-reactions-and-safety-concerns-and-report-them-to-the-yellow-card-scheme#fn:1)

It is estimated that over 4.3 million adults in the UK use vapes. They contribute to an extra 50,000 to 70,000 smoking quits a year in England. The Government is currently piloting a world first programme to provide 1 million smokers with free vape kits to help them quit.

Evidence reviews by the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID), and previously Public Health England[\[footnote 2\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/e-cigarette-use-or-vaping-reminder-to-remain-vigilant-for-suspected-adverse-reactions-and-safety-concerns-and-report-them-to-the-yellow-card-scheme#fn:2) show that e-cigarettes have been proven to be an effective smoking cessation tool and evidence shows that, in the short and medium term, vaping poses a much smaller overall risk than smoking. However, vaping is not risk free.[\[footnote 3\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/e-cigarette-use-or-vaping-reminder-to-remain-vigilant-for-suspected-adverse-reactions-and-safety-concerns-and-report-them-to-the-yellow-card-scheme#fn:3)[\[footnote 4\]](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/e-cigarette-use-or-vaping-reminder-to-remain-vigilant-for-suspected-adverse-reactions-and-safety-concerns-and-report-them-to-the-yellow-card-scheme#fn:4) Vaping is not recommended for non-smokers and children and the long-term risks are currently unknown.

In the UK, nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and e-liquids are regulated under the Tobacco and Related Products Regulations 2016 (as amended) which set the minimum requirements for the safety and quality of e-cigarette products. Before a nicotine-containing e-cigarette product can be placed on the market, it must be ‘notified’ to the MHRA through the [e-cigarette notification scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/e-cigarettes-regulations-for-consumer-products) to assess whether it meets the notification requirements to be placed on the market in the UK. The MHRA works with Trading Standards who are responsible for enforcing the safety and quality requirements for nicotine-containing e-cigarette products on the UK market to monitor the safety of e-cigarettes by collecting information about suspected safety concerns through the Yellow Card Scheme.

## Document e-cigarette use in medical records

Clinicians should ask about and document the use of e-cigarette products and vaping in the medical records for all patients as they would for smoking. Routine documentation will facilitate any future study on long-term effects of e-cigarettes or vaping using medical records.
Clinicians should routinely document:

- Name and brand of the product or products used

- Type of products (for example, a pre-filled disposable device or an e-liquid used with a refillable device)

- Duration and frequency of use

- Substances vaped (for example, nicotine, cannabidiol \[CBD\] or psychoactive substances)

- Strength of substances


## Advice for consumers

Under the regulations, only e-cigarette products with a nicotine concentration of up to 20mg/ml (2%) and a volume of nicotine-containing liquid not exceeding 2ml for pre-filled disposable e-cigarettes, cartridges and pods, or 10ml for e-liquid refills, can be supplied to consumers; any e-cigarettes or e-liquids with a nicotine strength and/or volume exceeding these limits are not legally compliant and are not approved for supply in the UK.

E-cigarettes and e-liquids that have been successfully notified and therefore meet the requirements for supply in the UK are published on the [MHRA ECIG Publications List](https://cms.mhra.gov.uk/ecig-new). Consumers can view this list and verify whether a product is notified by searching for the brand and product name or ECID number. Consumers should only purchase nicotine-containing e-cigarette products that are included on the MHRA Publications List.

## How to report any suspected adverse reactions and safety concerns

Healthcare professionals and members of the public can report any suspected adverse reactions (ADRs) or safety concerns associated with nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and e-liquids to the MHRA via the Yellow Card website.
Reporting contributes to the continuous monitoring and safety evaluation of e-cigarettes.

When submitting a Yellow Card report, please provide as much information as possible. The following information is particularly valuable for our assessment of reports:

- name and brand, strength, flavour, and batch number of the product used
- ECID number of the product (this is a 12-digit number that may be printed on the outer packaging or product itself)
- duration and frequency of use
- time to onset of the adverse reaction
- medical history including tobacco use and smoking status, details of any pre-existing respiratory disease, seizure disorders and cardiovascular history

Please include any other relevant information including concomitant medications or substances used.

As of October 2023, the MHRA has received 357 suspected ADR reports associated with nicotine containing e-cigarettes and e-liquids through the Yellow Card scheme and from industry. We routinely publish a summary of this data in our e-cigarette Analysis Print.

# Isotretinoin (Roaccutane▼): introduction of new safety measures, including additional oversight of the initiation of treatment for patients under 18 years of age

We have strengthened the safe use of isotretinoin through the introduction of additional oversight of the initiation of isotretinoin in patients under 18 years and through improved assessment and monitoring of mental health and sexual function issues. We ask healthcare professionals to review these new measures and supporting materials and integrate them into their clinical practice when referring patients and when prescribing or dispensing isotretinoin.

From:[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency)Published31 October 2023

Therapeutic area:[Dermatology](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=dermatology), [Dispensing GP practices](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=dispensing-gp-practices) and [Psychiatry](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update?therapeutic_area=psychiatry)

## Summary of measures

- 2 independent prescribers need to agree the initiation of isotretinoin in patients under 18 years
- New counselling requirements about potential mental health and sexual function side effects
- Assessment of mental health and sexual function before starting treatment and monitoring of mental health and sexual function during treatment
- New roles and responsibilities for healthcare professionals
- New regulatory risk minimisation materials

Following the [April 2023 recommendations](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/isotretinoin-roaccutanev-new-safety-measures-to-be-introduced-in-the-coming-months-including-additional-oversight-on-initiation-of-treatment-for-patients-under-18-years), the Isotretinoin Implementation Advisory Expert Working Group of the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) has developed guidance to support the safe implementation of the new regulatory position – consult the [Report of the Isotretinoin Implementation Advisory Expert Working Group](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-of-the-commission-on-human-medicines-isotretinoin-implementation-advisory-expert-working-group).

## Advice for healthcare professionals:

- all patients must be counselled about the benefits and risks of treatment before isotretinoin is prescribed, including possible mental health and sexual function side effects; we also ask the referrer (usually the GP) to provide information about isotretinoin to the patient and provide counselling (where possible) regarding the benefits and risks of isotretinoin treatment
- isotretinoin, as well as all of the [oral retinoid medicines](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/oral-retinoid-medicines-revised-and-simplified-pregnancy-prevention-educational-materials-for-healthcare-professionals-and-women) (including acitretin and alitretinoin), are teratogenic; all patients of childbearing potential must be entered into the Pregnancy Prevention Programme
- prescribers should assess patients’ mental health before prescribing isotretinoin including the use of patient-reported outcome measures
- ask patients about any sexual function concerns before prescribing isotretinoin
- give the patient sufficient time to consider, reflect and ask questions before starting isotretinoin treatment
- use the new regulatory risk minimisation materials with all patients: [Acknowledgement of Risk Form](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/653f8b1ed10f35000d9a6b53/Acknowledgement_of_Risk_Form.pdf), [Patient Reminder Card](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/653f8b2fd10f3500139a6b34/Patient_Reminder_Card.pdf), [Pharmacist Checklist](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/653f8b3de6c9680014aa9cee/Pharmacist_Checklist.pdf)
- the Lead Prescriber, who initiates isotretinoin treatment, must have expertise in the use of systemic retinoids for the treatment of severe acne and a full understanding of the risks of isotretinoin therapy and monitoring requirements
- initiation of isotretinoin treatment in patients under 18 years of age now requires agreement by 2 independent healthcare professionals that there is no other appropriate effective treatment before it is prescribed. This means that isotretinoin should only be prescribed for severe acne that is resistant to adequate courses of standard therapy
- review patients approximately 1 month after initiation of treatment in a face-to-face (in-person) appointment
- monitor patients for side effects including mental health and sexual function side effects at each follow up appointment including objective mental health patient reported outcome measures
- any healthcare professional involved in the treatment of patients with acne, particularly prescribers of isotretinoin, should review the full details of the new requirements in the [Report of The Commission on Human Medicines Isotretinoin Implementation Advisory Expert Working Group](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-of-the-commission-on-human-medicines-isotretinoin-implementation-advisory-expert-working-group)
- report suspected adverse drug reactions associated with isotretinoin on a [Yellow Card](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard)

## Advice for healthcare professionals to provide to patients:

- isotretinoin is an effective treatment for acne. It should be used for acne that is severe or at risk of causing permanent scarring when other appropriate treatments have not been effective
- all medicines have side effects. Not every patient experiences side effects, but you should know about them and what to do if they occur. This includes possible mental health and sexual function side effects
- inform your healthcare professional if you have any personal or family history of mental health issues or any sexual function concerns
- isotretinoin if taken during pregnancy can seriously harm an unborn baby. Patients must not become pregnant during treatment with isotretinoin and for 1 month after isotretinoin is stopped
- if you may be able to get pregnant your doctor must enter you into the Pregnancy Prevention Programme before you are treated with isotretinoin
- take time to think about the information provided by your doctor about the benefits and risks of isotretinoin and decide whether it is the right treatment for you
- your doctor will check that you understand the information in the Acknowledgement of Risk Form – you need to agree to all applicable points in the Acknowledgement of Risk Form in order to receive isotretinoin; make sure to keep your copy of the completed form safe
- read the Patient Reminder Card and keep it safe. It contains important safety information that you need to be aware of before and during treatment
- if you are under 18 years of age, 2 healthcare professionals must agree that there is no other appropriate effective treatment option before you start isotretinoin
- patients already being treated with isotretinoin should continue to follow their agreed treatment plan from their prescriber, but seek medical advice if they have any side effects or concerns
- report side effects associated with isotretinoin directly to the MHRA via the [Yellow Card scheme](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard)

## Isotretinoin treatment and new safety measures

Isotretinoin should only be prescribed for severe forms of acne (such as nodular or conglobate acne or acne at risk of permanent scarring) resistant to adequate courses of standard therapy with systemic antibacterials and topical therapy. Isotretinoin capsules are also known by the brand names Roaccutane and Reticutan in the UK.

In April 2023, the [Commission on Human Medicines (CHM)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/commission-on-human-medicines/about/membership) published [recommendations following their review of mental health and sexual side effects](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-of-the-commission-on-human-medicines-isotretinoin-expert-working-group) suspected to be associated with isotretinoin. The review considered all the available evidence, including information from patients and their families, and recommended new measures to strengthen the safety of isotretinoin treatment.

The product information for isotretinoin medicines has been updated following the review’s recommendations. This includes the addition of new warnings and precautions on potential mental health and sexual function side effects to the product information and the requirement for 2 healthcare professionals to agree that there is no other appropriate effective treatment in patients under 18 years of age.

## Isotretinoin Implementation Advisory Expert Working Group

Following their review, the CHM formed an Isotretinoin Implementation Advisory Expert Working Group, composed of experts and representatives of the healthcare organisations to advise on how best to implement the recommendations in clinical practice. The CHM endorsed the guidance from the Isotretinoin Implementation Advisory Expert Working Group.

### New guidance

The Isotretinoin Implementation Advisory Expert Working Group has worked with the MHRA to develop guidance specifying which healthcare professionals have the appropriate expertise to be the:

- Lead Prescriber, who makes the decision to initiate isotretinoin treatment

- Second Approved Named Healthcare Professional who agrees that isotretinoin is the most appropriate treatment option for adolescents under 18 years of age

- Follow-Up Prescriber responsible for continuing and monitoring isotretinoin treatment


The Lead Prescriber must have expertise in the use of systemic retinoids for the treatment of severe acne and a full understanding of the risks of isotretinoin therapy and monitoring requirements.

The Isotretinoin Implementation Advisory Expert Working Group also developed guidance on the assessment and monitoring of mental health and sexual function.

For further details see the [Report of the CHM Isotretinoin Implementation Advisory Expert Working Group](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-of-the-commission-on-human-medicines-isotretinoin-implementation-advisory-expert-working-group).

### New regulatory risk minimisation materials

New compulsory regulatory risk minimisation materials have been developed for use with all patients consisting of an Acknowledgement of Risk Form, a Patient Reminder Card and a Pharmacist Checklist. These are available electronically and will be sent to relevant healthcare professionals, including dermatology teams and pharmacy services GP practices, by post.

The Acknowledgment of Risk Form must be completed with all patients initiating isotretinoin treatment.

The new [Acknowledgment of Risk Form](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/653f8b1ed10f35000d9a6b53/Acknowledgement_of_Risk_Form.pdf) has been developed to:

- continue to record the patient’s acknowledgment of the known risk of harm to unborn babies during pregnancy
- record acknowledgment of other risks including possible mental health and sexual function side effects
- continue to record enrolment onto the revised Pregnancy Prevention Programme if the patient is of childbearing potential
- record the agreement of 2 independent healthcare professionals that there is no other appropriate effective treatment in patients under 18 years of age.

A package of additional supporting documents has also been developed by the British Association of Dermatologists, British Dermatology Nursing Group and other stakeholders to support these changes. These additional documents can be adapted to local needs and systems.

All healthcare professionals involved in the treatment of patients who may require isotretinoin should refer to the [Report of the CHM Isotretinoin Implementation Advisory Expert Working Group](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-of-the-commission-on-human-medicines-isotretinoin-implementation-advisory-expert-working-group) for further details, including a description of the isotretinoin treatment pathway.

## Report any reactions on a Yellow Card

Isotretinoin is a black triangle medicine and all suspected adverse reactions, including any sexual and psychiatric adverse reactions, should be reported via the Yellow Card scheme. Reports can be made of suspected reactions experienced at any time, including historic adverse experiences with medicines.

Please include in the report as much detail as possible, particularly if a side effect continued or started after treatment was stopped. Information about medical history, any concomitant medication, onset timing, treatment dates, and product brand name should also be included.

Report to the Yellow Card scheme electronically using:

- the [Yellow Card scheme website](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)
- the Yellow Card app; download from the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id990237487?pt=117756671&ct=EYC&mt=8) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.mhra.yellowcard&referrer=utm_source%3DEYC%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26anid%3Dadmob)
- some clinical IT systems for healthcare professionals (EMIS, SystmOne, Vision, MiDatabank, and Ulysses)

# MedSafetyWeek November 2023: your Yellow Card report helps to improve patient safety

The eighth annual #MedSafetyWeek social media campaign will take place from 6 to 12 November 2023. It will focus on the importance of reporting suspected adverse reactions to medicines and suspected problems with medical devices. We ask healthcare professionals to support the campaign and talk to their patients and colleagues about side effects and how to report safety concerns to the Yellow Card scheme.

From:[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency)Published31 October 2023

## What healthcare professionals can do to support MedSafetyWeek – 6 to 12 November 2023

- follow our social media channels and show your support for this year’s MedSafetyWeek by retweeting, commenting, liking, and sharing material with your social media contacts using #MHRAYellowCard, #MedSafetyWeek, #ReportSideEffects and #PatientSafety
- never delay in reporting suspected adverse drug reactions (side effects) to the [Yellow Card scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/) or via the Yellow Card app (download from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id990237487) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.mhra.yellowcard&referrer=utm_source%3DEYC%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26anid%3Dadmob)) – only a suspicion is needed to report a suspected reaction to us
- report suspected side effects to medicines, adverse incidents with medical devices (including software, apps and artificial intelligence), safety concerns about e-cigarettes and their refills, adverse reactions to herbal or homeopathic medicines, and defective, low-quality or falsified (fake) healthcare products
- report suspected adverse reactions associated with COVID-19 vaccines and medicines, as well as suspected incidents with medical devices and test kits, directly to the [Coronavirus Yellow Card reporting site](https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/) or use the Yellow Card app
- discuss with your patients:
  - the importance of taking the right medicine, at the right time, in the right way, and at the right dose and of carefully following instructions for use of medical devices
  - the importance of reading the Patient Information Leaflet that comes with a medicine or vaccine
  - what to do if they experience problems with a healthcare product, such as contacting a healthcare professional and reporting to the Yellow Card scheme
- talk to your colleagues about being vigilant for suspected adverse reactions with medicines or vaccines, especially new, serious or rare reactions or those that may have a delayed onset, and the importance of reporting them to the Yellow Card scheme

## About MedSafetyWeek

MedSafetyWeek is an annual event. It forms part of international efforts to raise awareness about the importance of reporting suspected adverse reactions to national medicines regulatory authorities, such as the MHRA. This year, regulators from over 80 countries will take part.

The theme for 2023’s campaign is ‘Who can report?’ All patients, carers, and healthcare professionals can contribute and play a key role in improving patient safety and strengthening the vigilance of healthcare products. You can read more about the global MedSafetyWeek campaign on the [Uppsala Monitoring Centre’s website](https://who-umc.org/medsafetyweek/).

This MedSafetyWeek, we remind you to report suspected adverse drug reactions to a medicine or vaccine directly to the Yellow Card scheme as soon as they arise. Do not wait or rely on someone else to report concerns. Only a suspicion is needed to submit a Yellow Card so, if in doubt, please do complete a report.

## About Yellow Card reports

The Yellow Card scheme helps us to monitor the safety of healthcare products once they are on the market. Reporting to the scheme allows the MHRA to identify new adverse effects and gain more information about known adverse effects. By completing a Yellow Card report, you help contribute to the safe use of healthcare products for patients.

Please report any adverse incident associated with a medicine or medical device through the Yellow Card scheme and [local reporting systems](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-yellow-card-scheme-guidance-for-healthcare-professionals#medical-devices-adverse-incidents). Potential problems with medical devices can also be [reported](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/managing-medical-devices).

It is particularly important that all suspected adverse reactions involving [Black Triangle medicines](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-yellow-card-scheme-guidance-for-healthcare-professionals#black-triangle-scheme) are reported. Yellow Card reports can also be made for products such as blood factors and immunoglobulin products, herbal or homeopathic medicines, and e-cigarettes and their refill containers (e-liquids). Read more about the different types of Yellow Card reports on the Yellow Card website.

The Yellow Card scheme has helped to identify numerous safety issues, many of which were not previously linked to a particular healthcare product until Yellow Card reports were received by the MHRA. Read our [case studies describing how Yellow Card reports have contributed to patient safety](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/casestudies).

## Resources for healthcare professionals

[More information](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/information) and [resources](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/resources), such as accredited e-learning modules and materials to help raise awareness locally, are available on the [Yellow Card website](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/). Links to new materials to download and print for local promotion and social media are being added to the \[MedSafetyWeek campaign page\]https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/MedSafetyWeek) ahead of this year’s campaign beginning on 6 November.

Healthcare professionals should also speak to their local Medication Safety Officer (MSO) or one of our six [Yellow Card centres](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/YCCs) to help support the campaign locally and help raise awareness. You can also discuss with your local Medical Device Safety Officer (MDSO) how you can help support the reporting of adverse incidents with medical devices.

Please encourage your colleagues to [sign up to receive alerts for Drug Safety Update](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKMHRA/subscriber/new?topic_id=UKMHRA_0044) and other safety information from the MHRA about medicines and medical devices. These messages are also available through the Yellow Card app (download from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id990237487) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.mhra.yellowcard&referrer=utm_source%3DEYC%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26anid%3Dadmob)).
